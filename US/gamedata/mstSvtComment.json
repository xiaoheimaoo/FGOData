The Shinmen clan granted him the right to use the Shinmen name, and so he called himself Shinmen Munisai. Shinmen Munisai had a dojo that taught the use of the jitte in Miyamoto village in Yoshinosato, which became Musashi's homeland. For this reason, she calls herself Miyamoto Musashi.\nShe would later go on to leave behind many legends, especially during her twenties, when she fought many other warriors.

She lives for love, and will die for love. On top of that, her pride in being regarded as a beauty has made her vain. As such, when she was summoned to this world as a Servant, she did a little digging in the history of the early 2000s and learned that high school girls were popular and considered to be highly beautiful during that time. These girls (at first glance) looked like they were having so much fun that Suzuka Gozen, enthralled by their way of life, immediately decided to adopt their style.

He later left the Shinsengumi and joined the newly formed government, living out the rest of his life into old age. Towards the end of his life, he was a man of few words, and seldom spoke about his days in the Shinsengumi. He often worked as a spy more than as a swordsman, and his solitary lifestyle where he seldom revealed his true intentions often led both his enemies and allies to see him as a man lacking a warrior's conviction.\n\n\"Well, there's some truth to all that. I kind of stumbled around from one place to another, just following my own interests. I always say that you lose when you die. If you don't die, that means you don't lose. That's the secret to my invincible sword. Or whatever.\"\n\nBut who really knows the truth of his actions. After all, he lived through the new era carrying a single flag—his own principle—in his heart until the very last moment of his life. ",

Accordingly, she has no intention of integrating or establishing relationships with the world of human culture and civilization. Though she may create the impression of a certain naivete, an ignorance of the pleasures of alcohol, a lack of experience with the finer luxuries of life, or even an innocence of the madness that so often takes people in the course of their lives, the moment she loses herself to her desires, she proves to be entirely unstoppable. So long as she is not provoked, she remains quite harmless, though she is at the same time far more dangerous than Shuten-Douji.\n\nThe moment she shows interest in something, she grows extremely attached. As long as the object of her affection continues to exist, she is prone to simply staring at it for extended periods. More often than not, when she so much as touches her obsession, she destroys it. At the very least, she brings such profound unhappiness to it as to end in the poor unfortunate's death. As her other aspect is an oni, she is especially drawn to other oni. Additionally, beings of the same types as her (children of divine dragons) tend to draw her keen interest as well.\n\n　◆\n\nThe above purports to be a description of Ibuki-Douji's nature, but the version of her which has manifested in Chaldea has proven to be a bit...different.\n\nShe has been...completely beguiled by the modern world.",

She seems to have studied a great deal about what it means to be human. She may even try to tempt or provoke those around her, including Master. Sherlock Holmes believes she either studied modern society somewhere, or met a Heroic Spirit who had, like her, grown more acclimated to the modern world. He believes that she was then able to use Chaldea's unique summoning system to her advantage to somehow bring that information with her into this manifestation. The truth, however, remains a mystery.\n\nThe moment the True Name of her Noble Phantasm is revealed, however, she reverts immediately to her more divine aspect. Even so, she seems to tremendously enjoy her persona as a carefree \"big sister snake.\"\n\n　◆\n\nAs a side note, when she is in her juvenile form (her First Ascension), her manner of speech and behavior are a mixture of her \"big sister snake\" and more divine personas. Her warnings about being \"dangerous when she molts\" likely refer to this more divine part of her aspect.",

She lets the waves of emotion take her, and the landscape painted within her \"Pillow Book\" is actualized in a sort of Reality Marble.\n\nTo Sei Shounagon, the repainted world becomes a familiar, nostalgic scene which then encroaches into the heart of the target who is incorporated into the bounded field.\n\nSorrow...nostalgia...poignancy...\n\nThe strong emotions that disturb her bubble up from within, allowing her to forget about battle, even if for a second, and the energy and power that possesses her is released, making the intense (and preposterous) attack unavoidable.\n\nAs a side note, \"Makura-no-Soushi, Shunshoshou\" is the annotated edition of \"The Pillow Book\" written by the poet Kitamura Kigin during the Edo period. That her thoughts have reached across time to strike a chord even with modern audiences is truly a stroke of luck for Sei Shounagon. She uses the \"Shunshoshou\" as a metaphorical bridge that connects the past to the future, combined with her line of \"Dawn is most beautiful in spring...\" (shunsho) to beautifully express her sentiments in her Noble Phantasm, ultimately subliming the title \"Makura-no-Soushi, Shunshoshou\" as her Noble Phantasm's name.",

Discarding both love and resentment of her previous lifestyle, she continued to live the rest of her life carrying the one hopeful star within her heart as she looked back at her incredible past life. Closing that door also meant that her star's light went out, and she did not have the means of becoming a guardian of humanity.\n\nHowever, due to an irregular summoning caused by a certain incident, Sei Shounagon was given another chance. Through the many connections she formed with the people she trusted and the many things she experienced, the long-dormant poet within her awoke, creating new possibilities within her that ultimately resulted in her being inscribed upon the Throne of Heroes. And so it became possible to summon her.\n\nEven should they never have experienced those wild times with her, Sei Shounagon surely anticipates the day she can finally reunite with them.",

Nobunaga is everything to him, and he resents the age of the warring states that failed to recognize his sister's talents, so took action by manipulating everyone in the household he deemed to be obstacles to his sister in a ploy to purge them, along with himself. Hypothetically speaking, had these siblings been born as commoners instead of into a daimyo family, they might have been able to live more harmoniously with each other.\n\nAs a side note, upon Nobukatsu's manifestation, those mysterious mini personas that probably came from taking a tiny fragment of Nobunaga's Spirit Origin (or whatever the hell they are) may also be summoned as an option for Nobukatsu.

    "comment": "The nation-building hero Romulus who was previously bound by human limitations has now revealed their aspect as a god. Normally there is no possibility for a Divine Spirit to be summoned with a Grand Spirit Origin. However, the fact that they were deeply involved with human history and, in a most unusual exception, were elevated into a supreme god despite being human, were the miracles what enabled them to be summoned as a Grand Lancer in the Fifth Lostbelt.\n\nIn the Fifth Lostbelt, many of humanity's Heroic Spirits attempted to go up against Zeus, the Lostbelt King, but they were wiped out entirely. Entrusting their final hope to Chaldea, knowing that they would soon arrive, the Heroic Spirits gathered the last of their strength and left a grand plan behind to survive them.\n\nAnd so, \"Operation God Destroyer\" was conceived, leading to the summoning of Romulus=Quirinus, a Heroic Spirit/Divine Spirit who was on the side of humanity, and possessed a human aspect while simultaneously being the supreme god of myth, as well as power equivalent to the thunderbolt wielded by Zeus, the Greek king of gods.\n\nWith the arrival of Chaldea, Operation God Destroyer came to fruition. When Romulus=Quirinus manifested in the Lostbelt, they fought alongside Chaldea to successfully defeat the swarm of Olympus's divine mechs.\n\nWhen the mechanical gods were destroyed, Romulus=Quirinus disappeared along with them, and it was thought that they would never manifest ever again... But the bonds they formed with Master, combined with the Spirit Origin registering on to the Trismegistus in Novum Chaldea, enabled their Spirit Origin to be summonable without the Grand title. With their summoning, they can once again wield their arms like shining spears in defense of humanity.",

She figured she could leverage that same maneuver but using a spear, which resulted in this Noble Phantasm.

She must have been vigilantly waiting for an opportunity to redeem herself.\n\nAnd finally, an opportunity presented itself.\nHonestly, doesn't she know when to give up?\n\nIshtar secretly \"borrowed\" precious ritual tools from Babylon's storehouse, and converted them into Holy Grails. With those powers, she set up an overlay of Venus across the land of Connacht and had powerful Heroic Spirits offer their power to the great land (read: race) so that Gugalanna could be created once again. Or at least that was the plan.\nThat was why the Shrine of Ishtar was converted into a giant magical energy resource integrated circuit. The Ishtar QPS (Quantum Piece System) would suck up magical energy from humans and even from Heroic Spirits and make it all its own...which made it the collection device from hell.

She speaks in a mild-mannered way, and her tone of voice is at times more girly.\nWhenever she speaks to others, she no longer comes across as patronizing, like an all-knowing teacher, but rather more like a student who is eager to learn about the universe.\nShe's like a little girl asking for you to read a book to her.\n\nUnlike other Heroic Spirits, Da Vinci was a ball of curiosity and aspiration, even after becoming a Servant. Even if their dreams were of a dead person, they lived in the now.\nLittle Da Vinci was no exception. She continuously runs around trying to figure out what she can do to achieve the best results. Yet, she is dissatisfied and worried about how much her current self's output has decreased. \n\nHer anxiety shows when she often asks, \"Am I doing as well as the former me?\"\nNo matter how much she inherited all of the previous Da Vinci's memories, none of those were actually experienced by Little Da Vinci.\nThat's why she idolizes the original Da Vinci's time spent with the staff at Chaldea.\nAt the same time, she yearns for something similar to herself. She feels a sense of responsibility, and a mission of hers is to accomplish something she can be proud of.",

The following are the Nemo Series that work in the docks.\n\nNemo Marine\nThe most nimble of the series, there are always twelve of these (twelve active on duty, maximum twenty-four). They all have the same personality and appearance. Nemo Marines represent the labor force that cleans, operates, maintains, and performs other miscellaneous tasks around the ship. They are always cheerful and never hate anyone (though they may not like everyone). While they may scream and shout a bit in emergencies, they will always do their very best to resolve the problem. The Marines are also the members of the Nemo Series in whom Triton's aspects are most clearly expressed.\n\nNemo Professor\nProfessor addresses everyone respectfully, which won Blackbeard’s friendship. As the name suggests, Professor works as the ship's resident intellectual and strategist, and is in charge of analysis, calculation, and devising strategies.\n\nNemo Engineer\nThe stubborn chief engineer who runs the ship's engine room with a fierce workman's spirit. Hers is one of the most dangerous and demanding jobs on the ship and she is driven by her motherly love and belief that protecting humans is her duty. She also sees herself and Captain as equally ranked, and so thinks she can take his place if he ever screws up. She loves humanity a great deal, but loves the Nautilus just as much.\n\nNemo Nurse\nShe is in charge of the infirmary and is the most mature, as well as tolerant and rational, of all the Nemo Series. Nurse always performs her duties with a cool head in an emergency.\n\nNemo Baker\nBaker is the member of the Nemo Series in charge of the most important part of the ship: the galley (bakery).

It's the bronze monster Tálos, an autonomous machine from the Age of Gods. This incredible weapon was crafted by none other than Hephaestus, one of the twelve gods of Olympus, and it was bestowed upon Europa by Zeus himself. The Noble Phantasm's sole and ultimate purpose is to protect Europa at all costs. Its durability is remarkable, and not even the gods can readily destroy it. While originally not a giant, but a monster, the fact that it was frequently mistaken for the Colossus of Rhodes has caused it to take the shape of a giant we see today.\n\nIt automatically detects and annihilates enemies. When it gets angry, its limbs become red-hot as it lunges at the target, and any ordinary creature would disintegrate in an instant on contact. In this game, the giant is summoned every time it's needed for attack, or when its True Name is revealed. It then detects its enemies and instantly flies into a rage. Its scorching hot iron fist hammers down into enemy territory.\n\nLong ago, on the Island of Crete, Europa often rode on Tálos's shoulders for fun, but this was very troubling for Tálos since it heats up whenever it gets angry. Please come down, my mistress. Tálos doesn't like the witch Medea. During the Age of Gods, she managed to attack its weakpoint—the heel—and the blood of the gods, known as ichor, which was also its source for magical energy, spilled out and immobilized it.",

Using his Mystic Eyes, Viy could expose secrets, seek out a fortress's weakness, and paint the walls with his enemies' blood.\n\nWithout the necessary aptitude, one could not even see him, much less control him. It was only on the very brink of death that Anastasia earned the right to form a contract with him.",

In truth, there may be even more secret ingredients necessary to produce the full effect.

Masters who mean to reprimand Semiramis for her attitude will first have to prove that they are of a higher station than she is, which will be a near-impossible task on its own.

There even remains a chance that she may poison her own allies if it means it would throw someone off their guard.

These efforts included Mara sending three beautiful daughters (some say they were the god himself disguised) to tempt Buddha, hurling a fiery disk, raining boulders and weapons down around Buddha, setting monsters upon Buddha, and unleashing heavy storms and rainfall. However, Buddha turned the disks and weapons into flowers, and Mara was unable to prevent Buddha from reaching enlightenment. Mara's attempts to obstruct Buddha's enlightenment and Kama's interruption of Shiva's meditation have resulted in this god being known as one with a love of tempting the faithful.\n\nKama/Mara can be said to be a god who embodies both the best and worst of love.",

And Sigurd readily accepted his nightly fate.\n\nOriginally this Spirit Origin transformation was suggested by Sigurd, who wanted to grant Brynhild's wish to spend just a few days without being engulfed with the desire to kill. But ultimately, Sigurd coming in contact with her caused her desire to kill (love) to swell so much that there was concern she might berserk at one point. And while Master and Sigurd were able to calm her before she went berserk, the two lovers found that they were destined to never be together. This Spirit Origin was designed to last for one fleeting summer moment.\n\n\"You are lovely in this Spirit Origin, but it's the normal you I love.\"\n...is what Sigurd supposedly said to her at the end of summer.\n\nThe words of her beloved made Brynhild smile.\nAnd while she smiled, she wept.",

Even if there is an enemy that normally is impossible to defeat, Holmes will discover some means to do so.\n\nAs a side note, while this NP's True Name is one of Holmes's best-known phrases, it first appeared not in Doyle's work, but in the stage play written by, directed by, and starring William Gillette. Doyle praised Gillette's Holmes as remarkable, better even than his own stories.\nBy the way, Holmes actually does use the word \"elementary\" in Doyle's short story \"The Adventure of the Crooked Man.\" It's said that is where Gillette derived his inspiration.",

At some point, Kiara turned the tables, taking Zepar over and becoming a demonic being with control over the Demon God Pillars. Over time, she changed into a Beast. Searching through multiple parallel worlds, Kiara sought out the most powerful, perfect version of herself and fused with her.\nThis brought the Void Phenomenon of CCC into the FGO world, and she transformed her own body into SE.RA.PH, growing by using Servants as a source of nutrition.\nHer intent from there was to merge with the Earth, but her plan was ultimately foiled by Meltryllis, BB, Passionlip, and Chaldea's Master.\n\nOnce she turned into an Alter Ego, she calmed down a bit.\nSpecifically, she vowed to herself that she would live a life of abstinence until her contract expires.\nAnd so, while her personality has not changed, she has stopped thinking of everything that crosses her path as prey.\nHer behavior towards Master is not unlike the demon Mara in Buddhist teachings.

Her enormous Command Spell covered her entire body, her talent in magecraft was top class, and her abilities as a Master were even greater. In addition, she also functioned as the container of the Lesser Grail.\n\nThe True Name recorded for her Spirit Origin is \"Sitonai,\" as she is the most prominent of the three Divine Spirits gathered in this vessel.",

Had she simply been left to her own devices, she would have become a cosmos-level catastrophe, so BB sealed her away in the bottom of Void Space.\n\nThe original Kingprotea was an innocent girl craving love, but when she was unleashed in the Abyssal Cyber City, SE.RA.PH, she gained a developing intellect, likely because of the person who replicated SE.RA.PH. She has the mental age of a fourteen-year-old, and is the epitome of a shy, frail girl. However, because she is hungry for love, she is aggressive even while acting innocent, and is very touchy-feely. It's like she gives off the vibe of a shy rabbit, but in actuality she's like a very friendly big dog.\n\nShe is not combative, but that doesn't mean she either hates or fears battle. Should she go into battle, she won't hesitate to annihilate her targets no matter how weak or low level the target is, and she will feel no pain in doing so.

In the myth, it is said that the gods sought the nectar of immortality, the Amrita, in order to survive on the desolate surface land. To create the Amrita, the ocean of milk (Kshirasāgara) surrounding the world needed to be churned. The gods formed an alliance with their enemy Asuras, and began churning the ocean of milk, using Mount Mandara as the axis, and created many life-forms and elixirs. Airāvata is the name of one of the giant elephants that was created from the ocean of milk during that process.\n\nThe Kingprotea that has been summoned for a limited time in Chaldea is perpetually suppressed.

Protea, as a giant so large that no normal human can see her entirely, flails her arms and legs to annihilate the enemy.

This is because she has no self-confidence, and so she takes joy in believing that being ordered around is the same as being loved. Protea is constantly ashamed of herself, since she is aware that she is a waste byproduct.\n\nShe has no interest in the outside world nor other humans, and simply seeks for Master's love. Calling it an innocent advance or blind devotion sounds nice and all, but in reality, it's a dangerous relationship, like walking a tightrope. Protea does not love Master because she has feelings for them, but simply because Master loves her, which shows that Protea only knows love without understanding true feelings of endearment and closeness. Should Master's affection run out, she will cease to feel love, and she will quickly become unsatisfied. Should that ever happen, Protea won't be able to endure her thirst for love, and will devour Master.\n\nUltimately, Protea is just like any of the other Alter Egos, born with a twisted sense of self. She will obediently follow Master's orders, but her submission is not total. In order for that to happen, Masters who form a contract with Kingprotea will need to further develop her mental state and essence as a being. This is also necessary for Masters to be able to escape Protea's inexhaustible, deep yearning.

Thus, undergoing multiple Ascensions enabled multiple aspects of Nobunaga to develop. Calling it a multitude of possibilities emerging may sound good on paper, but what actually happens is that one vanishes every time these divergences happen.

It is older than ancient space, and the goddess Ashtart had a cult of worship within prehistorical ancient civilizations, long before mammals existed on Earth.\nThese humans did not carry the notion of faith at that time, and so they considered goddesses simply to be a term for a sector that enabled life to exist.\nWhether the belief itself or its practices took shape to become a concept is unclear. Either way, Ishtar/Ashtart became a galaxy taking the form of a human. Normally she would not be someone who could be handled by humans, nor would she have ever become a Servant.\n\nBut when Professor Tokiomi coincidently discovered the spiritual core of the goddess, he raised her as the \"good half.\" Even after his death, he left his daughter in the hands of a trusted assistant.\n\"I may only be able to teach the textbook definition of what's good, but being the smart girl that she is, Space Ishtar's likely to see through the hypocrisy of the teachings, and she may lose interest in good and ultimately fall to the side of evil if I'm not there for her.\nHowever, by being close to Jane, who is genuinely good without being two-faced and is able to get to the truth of things (despite paying the price of calling forth destruction and chaos), Space Ishtar may realize that good and evil are not always two sides of the same coin. Hopefully she won't fall to evil that easily.\"\nAs the professor predicted, Space Ishtar grew up with a sound(?) mind and body, and did not fall to evil, instead training to become a superb straight man to Jane's one-woman comedy act. Although she has a short fuse and is a bit stingy, she became a fierce bounty hunter who helps the weak and bites back at the strong.\nMeanwhile, Jane didn't change at all.",

During her journey back up to the surface, she saw a group of mermaids, and so she incorporated mermaid attributes into herself. What's more, for some reason, this High Servant had a truly outlandish thought: \"If I'm going to revive, I might as well start from my youth!\"\n\nWhile Kiara turning into her lily form was entirely for her amusement, the transformation also served to deceive Xu Fu. Kiara afflicted her lily form with amnesia, so she would not remember even her own name, which is why her lily form believes herself to be a Pseudo-Servant of the legendary nun Yaobikuni.\n\nAfter returning to the lake to get back at Xu Fu, she concealed her true identity and changed the settings and environment to suit her own enjoyment while keeping the death game rules intact. When the fake Master (Xu Fu) on the B side of the mountain near the lake declared that the group should try \"to resolve the situation,\" she actually meant for them to \"try to figure out who took over the B side of the mountain.\"\n\nIn her lily form, Kiara wholeheartedly desired to help Master, and during tough times, she used her makeup compact (sea shell) to turn into police Kiara (Second Ascension) to combat evil. However, this transformation also brought her memories back, so she reverted to her lily form because \"it would be no fun to reveal everything so quickly.\"",

She was just a sensitive girl of a tender age who never once thought to be suspicious of others.\n\nThe Puritans placed value on earthly hardships, and they crossed the Atlantic ocean to flee the oppression of the power hungry church, and ended up in the New World. However, others eventually caught up to and cornered them. Their \"protest\" was soon directed to their neighbors and those nearby.\n\nIn answer to what they saw as the moral decay of the world around them, the Puritans embraced the steadfast belief that one must restrain oneself, which became their way of monitoring one another. The difficult colonial life rife with war and pillaging soon created a mentality of suspicion and selfishness.\nHysteria gripped the people, and they sought to lay the blame at witches' feet. They began to believe that their misfortunate was the work of the devil himself.\n\nThe gates of the atrocious witch trials soon opened with the emergence of witches in Salem. This tumultuous situation became the keyhole while the girl became the key that reflected the sentiments of the people.

    "comment": "The historical man Vincent van Gogh was born to a Dutch minister's family in 1853. After working as an art dealer and book seller, he attempted to become a missionary, but ultimately gave up, and instead set out to become a painter himself. He studied under members of the Hague School, and later formed his own artistic style after being influenced by Impressionism.\n\nAfter moving to Arles, France, he created many masterpieces such as \"Sunflowers\". However, his mental health started to suffer after his relationship with his roommate Gaugin deteriorated, which led to the infamous incident of Van Gogh cutting his own ear off. From then on, Van Gogh continued to paint even while suffering from his mental state, and in 1890, at the young age of 37, Van Gogh took his own life. Many scholars argue that there are some inconsistencies surrounding his death.\n\nVan Gogh preferred to use yellow hues and sunflower motifs, as they were symbolic of the sun's rays. He also collected Japanese ukio-e paintings, and would even incorporate them into his own work. In his later years, he was drawn to include cypress trees in his works, and may scholars suggest that they were representations of his view on life and death.",

She was Apollo's lover, but was driven mad with jealousy when his affections turned to Leucothoe, the daughter of the Persian king Orchamus, and Clytie's schemes of defamation led to Leucothoe's demise. However, Clytie failed to win back Apollo's love, and she was left to stare longingly at the sun, eventually transforming into a solitary flower.\n\nVan Gogh's personality and body are mainly Clytie's. This is why her appearance mixes flowers and jellyfish as she undergoes Ascension, as well as why she dresses like she's in mourning in her second Ascension, which reflects the deep sadness and regret she constantly experiences. Her low self-esteem and flirtatious smile are likely due to her self-loathing after her own foolish actions cost her everything she loved. Perhaps she is so insistent that she is Van Gogh out of a desire to hide from the parts of her that are not Van Gogh.",

    "comment": "This \"key\" supposedly existed in Salem, Massachusetts for a time. It was there for a few decades, but considering the key's existence is measured in centuries, that time span is just a blink of an eye. The key was methodically preserved by a thaumaturgist, who came from England. It was wrapped in parchment and then placed inside a box made out of fragrant wood that emitted a sweet-smelling aroma. The key granted special powers to the possessor. But it couldn't be in the hands of just anybody. There were specific conditions that had to be met. The conditions were that the individual had to be innocent, possess the heart of a child, and have knowledge of magecraft. This was because the key was connected to the dream world. This was due to the fact that, according to the \"Book of Eibon,\" \"Necronomicon,\" and other grimoires, the key was created by a thaumaturgist who came from the northern continent that had sunk during the Glacial Period. While it is indeed called a key since it closely resembled the excavated artifacts from the ruins of Rome, there was no lock that was paired with it. It was essentially a key based off of a concept, and it should have actually been called something similar to a staff that thaumaturgists wield. When the catastrophe that was the Witch Trials of Salem occurred, the key should have been lost and hidden away as just another myth or superstition. However, it found an individual who met the conditions to inherit it. The girl's name was Abigail Williams. The girl rightfully and correctly used the key, handed to her by the Demon God Pillar, during sunset, when the hills of the execution site turned crimson the moment the celestial bodies aligned. Iä! Iä! The red seal on the devil's tome inscribed by the women suspected to be witches... The same knots of the same number of nine seals were handled with the same motion fit for each seal...and the girl opened up the door that led to the \"Boundary.\" Iä! Iä! Y-grah'n li'gai gai! Those who gaze back on us from within the abyss of falsity. O lord of the ultimate gate who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams. O, All-in-One and One-in-All being. We must caution those who come in contact with the young girl. The girl's existence shall put the world into uncertainty. But... Oh... Ohhh...\n\n...The excerpt ends there.",

Therefore, she would never entrust the Universe Rings to another unless she trusted them absolutely.\n\nIf there was someone whom Nezha trusted enough to give one of the Rings, it would mean that she considered that person so close as to be a part of herself.

As Hokusai passed away in the same year at the age of ninety, this painting is often considered one of Hokusai's very last.\nAfter he completed the \"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\" at age seventy, his passion for art didn't fade as he continued to create. He went so far as to dismiss his creations before the \"Thirty-Six Views\" as worthless doodles. It is said he started to grasp the essence of all animal's skeletal structures and the secret of life for all plants at the age of 73. By eighty, he had furthered his understanding of all things in nature. By ninety, he had reached enlightenment. Had he lived to one hundred years old, his skill might have reached the realm of the divine. By one hundred and ten, he could have made his paintings come alive.\nArtists of his time understood the rising dragon over Mt. Fuji to be an auspicious sign, one that signifies a person's rise to success. However, one can also see Hokusai's endless conviction in this painting. Even as he sensed his own end, he did not give in to despair and continued his endless pursuit of artistic heights none before him had ever attained.",

I'll never forget the time loop that was both never-ending and somehow over so quickly, or how super cool I looked during my tropical getaway.\n\nNow that I'm on a long-term mission, I won't be able to stop by Earth anytime soon, but everything should be back to normal by the time I visit again.

All patients have to do is to trust their doctor. Asking questions like, 'what is this medicine?' and 'why are you doing that?' is futile, even infuriating.

Saint-Exupéry was a plane enthusiast, so much so he purchased yet another airplane even after his crash, going so as far as to incur considerable debt. Throughout his life, he had many crashes and accidents. One such accident at the age of twenty-three caused him to break off an engagement. At the age of thirty-five, when he crash landed in a desert, he managed to survive for four days on only one day's worth of water until he was rescued by a nomadic tribe called the Bedouin. Finally at the age of forty-four, he was assigned to a military scouting mission using an unarmed aircraft. He was shot down and finally met his demise.\n\nWhile he was a well-known author, he was an aviator at heart, a man who continued to look up to the sky.\n\n\"...Well, at least that's how the legend goes.

As the nation was plagued by constant conflict, the shrine maiden who received oracles from the starry heavens became queen. The queen's shrine was surrounded by sturdy fences and guarded by numerous soldiers, and a great many attendants served her. However, since she became queen, she never met anyone outside the confines of her shrine, and only one person, her nameless brother, was said to have assisted her and delivered her oracles.\n\nYep. Even though I was queen, I was living this life of solitude. And anytime I tried to sneak out of the shrine, it would always rain, which kept me from going out. So the only thing I could do was either more divinations or polish my mirrors. I had tons of mirrors, but this one's special. My brother got it from me from...somewhere, before I became queen. I spent a lot of time looking into it when I was bored.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the mirror. Whenever my stomach growled, my brother would give me his own food, and he would dote on me, always saying \"Sister\" this and \"Sister\" that. Even after I became queen, he would constantly run errands in my place. He really did so much for me, and he offered everything he had to me. In the end, no one even remembered him... He became this nameless brother of mine. And this is the mirror he gave me.\n\n...My favorite mirror.",

Despite living a long and full life, he spoke little about his comrades he fought alongside in the past, even towards the end of his life. In the age when the life of the samurai started to fade away, this man firmly stood his ground and continued to live like a samurai.\n\nThat sounds really good in writing, but in truth, I actually have pretty loose lips. The moment I open my mouth, I just blabber about all kinds of things that may or may not be true. One time, there was this young man who was training really hard with his wooden sword at a dojo, and I just went right in and gave him this long lecture on the importance of tsuki. You know what? You don't have time to think about how to properly attack or parry. You just get really into the moment and start swinging your sword around. You get what I mean?\n\nThat's just how it was back in the day though.\n\nThey immersed themselves in fighting, laughed and cried enthusiastically, and died in a frenzy. That's how they all lived in that age. That's when I thought I should at least live my life carrying my own banner till the very end.\n\nOne member of the Shinsengumi who fought through the turbulent age of the Bakumatsu and survived. Nobody knows what was going through his mind.\n\n\"Hey guys. Did you get what you wanted in the end?\"",

I wanted to go on a heart-pounding adventure. It wasn't just the readers who longed for a man of faith who was also eccentric, mysterious, and scary.\n\nAnd the reason why I, as this fragmentary Phantom Spirit, started to get serious was when I met the protagonist, who was just as incomplete, helpless, and they wouldn't be able to get by unless someone had to take care of them.\n\nAdventures test and cultivate anyone equally.

But ultimately I still chose to do so because I'm confident that you would understand. So this is me. This is my face that you had shown me to love. If I'm talking from Clytie's standpoint, I tried painting in the style from the Arles period because I like its coloring. It's probably close in style of that sunflower painting that sold for a few million. But this painting for you should go perfectly well on the right side of the wall in your drab room. And if for some unfortunate reason you find yourself struggling, you can go ahead and sell it. But when you do, I look forward to you buying me a cup of coffee and telling me the story of how much that \"painting of an unknown monster girl with an authentic Van Gogh autograph\" sold for.\nIt looks like I'm reaching my limit with my advanced Van Gogh joke of borrowing Vincent's artistic talent and writing style. The haughtiness is crushing me, and I still need to explain myself to Gioconda Da Vinci who keeps banging on my door on why I used so much painting materials during my many trial and errors for this painting. (Though her existence as an artist still puzzles me no matter how many times I hear the story). Luckily Hokusai's with me so she can probably side with me. Oh...as I was writing this sentence, she took off leaving the little black Hokusai behind, so now I don't have anyone else to sweet talk my way out!\nI'm going to entrust this letter and painting to the little black Hokusai. If you see me in the halls nursing a bump on my head, some treatment and consolation would be appreciated.\n\nWith my unwavering loyalty and friendship, a handshake to you.",

    "comment": "Valentine's chocolate from [servantName 503300].\n\nDo you have a moment, Master?\n\nI'd like to discuss something with you. Oh, I know. It's that time of year. I know very well why you are so restless...like you're waiting for someone.\nBut would you spare a few minutes to listen to what I, Medea, would like to say?\n\nWhat I want to discuss is my magecraft workshop.\nThey...they took it over! Auntie and Medea Lily!\n\nThey said they were going to convert it into a kitchen so they could make confections!\nAnd they were going to call it the Witches’ Kitchen, and it will only be open on Valentine’s Day!\nWhat a nuisance. Besides, calling it the Witches’ Kitchen is a bad idea. It’s like blatantly admitting that the food has special properties and ingredients!\nBut then Auntie said...\n“We, as highly celebrated witches of myth, must create and use only objects of the highest quality...from confectionary-making tools to aprons! It’s like just like how one must have the proper feathers if one wishes to fly!”\n...She was quite enthusiastic about it.\nJust the fact that she’s spending time making sweets is taking away from her being a witch... Doesn’t she realize that she’s just an amateur pâtissier at this point?\nShe even tried to persuade me to join, but I politely declined.\n\nEh? You think that’s a shame?\nI already got involved because I lent them my aprons?\n\n...Your eye is keen as ever. I confess, it’s true. \nNever mind Lily, but Auntie...\nShe may not seem it, but she actually looks good no matter what she wears.\nSo I may have gone a bit overboard, working feverishly at my sewing machine.\nBut Auntie was a bit judgmental. She said that she never knew I had such homely talents! Ugh!\n\nAt any rate, I’m quite proud of how cute the little chef coats turned out. I can’t speak to the quality of the pastries, but I want you to at least pay attention to how wonderful their outfits are. \nSince it seems I have no choice, I suppose I will let my workshop go for now and just crash in some Saber’s room.\n\nThat’s why I’m here, Master. I have a few questions.\nAuntie’s been barging into my room, day and night, asking me so many things.\n\nHere are some of the things one of mythology’s greatest witches has been asking of me:\n“I want to know what Master’s favorite flavor is. Do you think they like it really sweet? Or would bitter be better?”\n“Are there any seasonings Master doesn’t like? You know, so I can balance things properly in the future..”\n“Now that I think about it, handmade confections are so lame. What do you think, Medea?”\n“If Master was a pig in their past life, what breed do you think they’d have been? I hear there’s a hybrid brand of pigs called Tokyo ● from Japan. Sounds romantic, huh? It has ● in its name!”\nWho cares about breeds...\n“Hey Medea...I hear that Master is really traumatized by Valentine’s Day. Even if they eat our chocolates with a smile while we watch, I hear there’s vomiting back in Master’s room... Sounds like a joke, doesn’t it? Huh?”\n\n...So, there you have it. Phew.\nAnyway, it looks like Auntie’s a bit occupied right now and she can’t come over, so she sent me here on her behalf. Really, Lily should be doing this, not me.\nHonestly, Auntie is so fickle she gives me a headache. Teehee. Don’t you agree, Master?\nBut it does look like, in spite of herself, she’s doing her best, so would you be so kind as to answer the questions I asked? \nOh, it’s fine. You don’t need to be so formal and thank me...eh?\nI-I keep telling you! \nI-I-I’m Medea!!! Really! Honest!\nI-I-I-I told you when I got here! I’m not lying!!!\nHonestly, you are SO rude!!!",

And even in modern times, it is shared amongst friends for lively conversation, or as an alluring drink that leads love to blossom.\n\nChocolate, which is made with cacao, was also a luxury drink fit for the upper class.\nIts superb effects were highly valued, and in Mesoamerica, where cacao originated, the beans itself were used as currency.\n\nWith that in mind...\nA certain queen who possesses the Eye of the Spirits and has insight to appraise things even in this modern world, stopped by a sundries shop that was brightly lit even in the dark of night, and picked up a somewhat nostalgic snack...  \nThat's right...\n\nShe saw a business opportunity...\nThe act of just wandering around the store without any purpose...to kill some time...\nGiving a knowing glance towards a confused shop clerk...\nFor her, this is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n*Under discussion\n[Eha●] \"Oh crap...\"\n[Shta●●] \"The shop clerk is totally serious.

There were even fights.\nBut the young couple worked hard and earnestly.\nTheir disappointments eventually gave way to hope and security.\n\nLunar New Year is coming once again.\nThe shop gets quite busy, making traditional confectionary that is essential to every Chinese person living abroad.\nAnd it was then that a certain order came in.\n\"Qíngrénjié.

While praying, they recalled the discussion with the young couple.\nThey are with child, and they want the aging couple to think of a name for their unborn child.\nA lotus flower is a symbol of children and a prayer for safe childbirth.\nAfter some thought, the shop owners decide to accept the order.",

It is a story of an ordinary main character who deepens his bond with various heroines.\n\nThe first heroine is able to communicate with spirits, and knew the main character long before the main character knew her. When they are reunited a few years later, it appears he forgot the important promise made with the heroine. \"Hnngh. It feels like I'd be a loser if I reminded him of my promise...so I'll make the spirits jog his memory!\" Oh, also, within just two days of their reunion, there was a whole scare about the main character having to suddenly move away.\n\nThe second heroine is a senpai-next-door sort of heroine who had always taken good care of the main character. She could be both stern and sweet. The way she embraces the main character is more akin to how a big sister or mother might do so. But, be warned that she can be more frightening than an oni when angered. \"Oh my, look how dirty you are. Would you like me to give you a bath while I rubby-rub you all clean like we did back in the day?\"\n\nThe third heroine is...well, she's a stalker who fell in love with the main character at first sight after he came into her home to shelter from the rain. Their first words were exchanged when the main character peeked under his bed in the middle of the night, sensing something strange. \"I love you! Kya! I said it! When should we sign our marriage certificate?\"\n\nAt their school, there's an urban legend that says that anyone who summons the goddess of love under the legendary tree will find the love they desire. But obviously, the heroines vying for the affection of the main character surely will not let their rivals get ahead. And so, the goddess who flirts with the bear remains up in the heavens, while the great war for love rages down on the surface...",

For some reason, you feel your heart flutter whenever you look at the chocolates, though.\n\nPerhaps they were molded using some sort of magical energy. They do melt when they're left out in room temperature, so you'll need to eat them as soon as possible. All of them.",

However, the amount of thought and heart she put into hers is a match to her original self. The chocolate Shadow Border on top of the cake is actually a perfectly preserved food.

Dividing them up between two people will leave one left over, and it's up to the couple how that one cookie should be split and eaten.\n\nYou really gambled on this one, Miyamoto Musashi!",

The theory is that the Authority is readily customizable, and just like the infinite number of stars in space, there are an endless number of selves that can deal with all.\n\nIn other words, Kama/Mara exists infinitely within the universe that is herself.\n\nNega-Desire: A\nA potent skill unique and native to the Beast of Desire. No matter the target, anything that has even a modicum of greed will be corrupted by love itself. If all desire and lust that exist in the universe can be granted through infinite love, that would also mean that the concept of greed can be eliminated from this universe.",

    "comment": "She was mandated to be intimately involved with the love affairs of all the world, and was annihilated after getting involved in said affairs... The god of love, as a result, gained infinity, and naturally became weary of love. Thus, she tries to fulfill everything using her own infinite love. After all, if the universe (humanity) is fulfilled by her love, then there would be no further annoyance of the love affairs between people that so irk her.\n\nThis Beast scatters passion (or arrows of it) throughout humanity that are sufficient to burn the universe. Anything goes. It doesn't matter how low they stoop. Love them through and through even if they are corrupted to the point of becoming animals. Embrace them. That kind of ultimate pampering is what Kama/Mara can offer. She offers love (temptation) as she once did for Buddha...but now to each and every person of this universe.\n\n\"The vow to cut off all vexations...must be so hard on you. Don't worry, I'll burn all your worries away.\"\n\nThe sight of her enjoying herself by scorning the Buddha's vow with a smile is the very image of the Demon King, the great enemy in Buddhism.\n\nAnd so, based on her original nature, her class was determined:\nThe god of love is a false name.\nThe byproduct of a god of evil...the greatest catastrophe that is said to save humanity itself.\nHer name: Beast III/L.\nShe is one of the Seven Evils of Humanity, the Beast possessing the aspect of lust.",

    "comment": "『Saṃsāra Kama/Mara Avaruddha』\nRank: EX\nNP Type: Anti-World\nRange: 100 - 99999\nMaximum Targets: 1\n\nThe Realm of Love, The Burning Universe.\nThe Noble Phantasm exclusive to Beast III/L. Unusually, it has two True Names. This is to indicate that they are two sides of the same coin. The word saṃsāra means \"cycle\" in Sanskrit, and it's derived from Kama's other name, Samsaraguru. Avaruddha in Sanskrit means \"obstruction,\" and it points to Mara's many attempts to interfere with Buddha...the temptation towards corruption.\n\nCoercing the indulgences of love that are both good and bad... The ultimate corruptive Noble Phantasm that represents both Kama and Mara, who possess demonic natures on a cataclysmic level. When one experiences this Noble Phantasm inside Kama's universe, they will undoubtedly behold a true hell—or perhaps paradise—of Kama sending herself (or copies of herself) to all without discrimination, and burning up the universe with her one-sided love to exhaust her targets.",
