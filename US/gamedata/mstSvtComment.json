The Shinmen clan granted him the right to use the Shinmen name, and so he called himself Shinmen Munisai. Shinmen Munisai had a dojo that taught the use of the jitte in Miyamoto village in Yoshinosato, which became Musashi's homeland.

    "comment": "Perhaps because her wish to spend her life with someone who loved her back was never fulfilled during her lifetime, Suzuka Gozen manifested here and wished upon the Holy Grail for love. She lives for love, and will die for love. On top of that, her pride in being regarded as a beauty has made her vain. As such, when she was summoned to this world as a Servant, she did a little digging in the history of the early 2000s and learned that high school girls were popular and considered to be highly beautiful during that time. These girls (at first glance) looked like they were having so much fun that Suzuka Gozen, enthralled by their way of life, immediately decided to adopt their style. While her style was born from a slight misunderstanding, Suzuka Gozen at least seems to like it.\n\n\"Since I've become a like, totes amazing high school girl, I should show hella pride in repping my fam. I can seem like, max calculating and it's cool, 'cuz it'd just SUPER embarrass girls everywhere if I was all worried about being the winner and stuff.\"\n\nThere you have it. Looks like she completely respects high school girls from the bottom of her heart.\nSeems like she takes everything very seriously.",

It never ages, dulls, or chips, and can cut through just about anything. Its golden hilt is inlaid with many rare holy relics which did not exist in Hektor's time, making it extremely effective as a Conceptual Weapon as well. One of its lesser-known effects is its ability to create miracles. As long as a given phenomenon is physically possible, Durendal can probably help make it happen, albeit at tremendous cost.\n\n　　　◆\n\n『Roncesvalles Olifant』\nRank: C\nNP Type: Anti-Army\nRange: 1 - 10\nMaximum Targets: 100\n\nGreatly Delayed Horn.\nAn olifant (etymologically derived from an alternative spelling of \"elephant\") is a type of hunting horn. Roncesvalles is the place where most of the Twelve Paladins, including Roland himself, died in battle. Despite falling into a trap and finding himself and his companions vastly outnumbered, Roland was reluctant to use this horn to call for help. Eventually, though, he did so. However, according to his friend, the wise general Olivier, this decision came too late. Roland blew his horn as loud as he could, and succeeded at calling Charlemagne and additional reinforcements. But they arrived too late and most of the Twelve Paladins died in battle.\n\nA somewhat unusual Noble Phantasm that can help its user break free of a sticky situation. In one sense, you could even think of it as a miracle within Durendal's possession.\nThe harder the horn is blown, the easier the situation at hand becomes to deal with, but at the expense of injuring Roland. In this game, Roncesvalles Olifant appears as a skill rather than a Noble Phantasm.",

    "comment": "A virtuous, devout young hero who gained popularity in epic poems like \"The Song of Roland\" and \"Orlando Furioso.\" Unfortunately, he still has some growing up to do, as is amply demonstrated by the way in which he absolutely loses his mind when rejected in a romantic pursuit.\n\nHis Monstrous Strength is sufficient to let him tear a person apart with his bare hands, and his body is so tough some sincerely believe it to be made of diamond. Seldom were these qualities more clearly demonstrated than in his showdown with a great sea beast; he crushed the creature with his own ship's anchor. However, he is not without his flaws. Most notable is his extremely regrettable proclivity to abandon his given mission and chase after the beautiful Angelica. Still, at least up to that point, he was the very model of a brave and valiant paladin.\n\nOne day, Roland fell into a trap laid by his resentful stepfather, Ganelon. Expecting to encounter minimal resistance to their twenty-thousand strong force, he and the other Twelve Paladins instead found themselves facing an army of four-hundred thousand. Though they fought valiantly, in the end, many heroes fell to the foe's sheer numbers.\n\nDespite being so dreadfully outnumbered, Roland could not use his olifant to call for reinforcements until the very end. Olivier reproached him for his indecision on a matter so crucial, in circumstances so dire.\n\"Were you really so desperate to prove your heroism?\"\nTo which Roland replied, \"It wasn't that...\"\n\"Then why didn't you swallow your pride and call for help sooner?\" Olivier asked.\nIn response, Roland said, with deep shame in his heart, \"It's pathetic. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't blow it. Even now, I still can't believe my own stepfather turned on me.\"\nThat was when Olivier finally realized that the unabashedly kindhearted man standing before him, despite knowing both tragic love and deeply held anger, would never adjust to the notion of those he trusted betraying him.\n\nOnly when he was the last one standing could Roland bring his olifant to his lips. Even as blood gushed from his body, he shoved his regrets aside and blew as long and hard as he could...until it felt like his brain itself was about to burst. When he was done, he kept fighting until he drew his dying breath...confident that the help his horn had summoned would see his stepfather brought to justice.",

Her behavior would probably change after she learned to distinguish individuals. Should she take an interest in you, it would be wise to exercise caution rather than see this as a cause for celebration. Her touch is the touch of a god, and not even poison defense magecraft or anti-poison skills can completely neutralize its effects. That said...ever since she materialized at Chaldea, she's been acting as though she and Master are very close. Okay, in fairness, she's been acting that way with everyone. She'll probably need to deepen their relationship considerably if she's ever going to be able to tell Master apart from anyone else. In that sense, it's safe to assume that Ibuki-Douji's true nature hasn't changed.\n\n　　　◆\n\nApparently, she once met Sakata Kintoki in Ashigara a very, very long time ago.

Each morning, he went to the capital and killed any oni he encountered, then returned home. This was his routine, each and every day. Were he born in modern times, he might have been a businessman who acted always with perfect dedication to his job (with no need to ever put in overtime). He was an exceptional man who never neglected his training and worked always to improve his skills, no matter what.\n\nThough he understands human behavior, he has no desire to partake in it. He understands human emotion, but it is unclear whether those emotions do indeed exist within him. This is, however, complicated by the fact that he isn't entirely lacking in emotion. He may risk his life in defense of his friends or innocent people, but never grows emotional in the doing...almost like a robot programmed to help people. His explanation for this is that he does what he does simply because it is what's expected of him. Tsuna also does not think of himself as human, which is why it is so much harder for him to kill humans than oni. When he expressed this to Kintoki and some others, they were at a loss for how to respond.\n\nAn outcast since childhood, he understands that the only links he has to humanity are that he is one of Raikou's Four Kings, is a warrior, and that he slays oni. The only exception to this is the golden-haired oni who is resplendent yet cruel. She is the only one who stirs up any kind of emotion in Tsuna.",

Muramasa swords are also often portrayed as blood-soaked demonic blades in several kabuki plays and other narratives, as well as legends the revolve around the adversaries of the Tokugawa clan.\n\nYui Shousetsu, who plotted to overthrow the Shogunate in 1651 A.D., is said to have owned a Muramasa blade, and Sanada Yukimura is also said to have owned one according to the series of biographies titled \"Meisho Kotogiroku.\" \n\nBy the Bakumatsu period, Saigou Takamori led prominent figures in an attempt to overthrow the Shogunate, and they also sought out the Muramasa.

    "comment": "In this form, Majin Okita Souji, i.e. Okita Alter, is a little bit removed from the latter's Spirit Origin. It is a form that could never be, yet might have been, a form from before she was worn down over the course of her impossibly long battle. As a result, she is somewhat more emotional and expressive than she is as her usual Okita Alter self. Then again, it could just be the magical energy from the summer sea.\n\n...So, as you can see, this Spirit Origin's reconstruction led to Okita Alter splitting into two people. This was the result of Rengoku, Okita Alter's weapon, cutting off a part of Okita Alter's Spirit Origin and fusing it to themself in order to function independently.\n\nRengoku's true function is as a failsafe—a euphemism for \"self-destruction device\"—whose purpose is to seal away Okita Alter's tremendous power and destroy her for good if she should ever lose control. However, Rengoku became self-aware while fighting by Okita Alter's side over the course of their long, long battle, and unconsciously developed a desire to destroy themself rather than end Okita Alter's life.\n\nIt was during this manifestation that this desire came to the surface, which led to them cutting away the self-destruct function in Okita Alter's Spirit Origin and using it to materialize what amounted to a smaller version of their wielder.\n\n...This was my chance to disappear. I thought that once I was gone, then maybe my wielder would finally be able to escape this stupid fate. But even after she found out about all of it, she said she still wanted to keep using me.\n\nRight... I see now.

This is because, as he is the version grounded in reality, Charles the Great considers Joyeuse to be no more than a sacred sword that is the subject of a flight of fancy.\n\nIn terms of pure destructive power, Joyeuse Ordre is just about as strong as Roland's Durendal when its True Name is released. Of course, as Charlemagne is not a knight, but a king, he would still lose to Roland if they were to clash directly. However, when Charlemagne is demonstrating his kingly heroism—that is, his royal dignity and majesty, Joyeuse gains twelve additional blades: one for each of the Twelve Paladins' legends. Once again, these are not replacement blades, but additional blades on top of the original. This alone obviously multiplies Joyeuse's strength by thirteen, and that's without taking into account the extra power it receives from Charlemagne's kingly charisma. When all is said and done, Charlemagne is able to wield no fewer than thirteen versions of Joyeuse however he likes, including the one in his own hand, as he sets about attacking his opponent. While its range and maximum targets may be limited to 1, that is only because this Noble Phantasm is technically directed at Charlemagne himself. If it were to be converted into more conventional range, it would easily be the equivalent of a medium-level Anti-Army Noble Phantasm.\n\nAll told, these thirteen strikes are some of the best attacks wielded by any warrior, and are a feat not even the greatest Greek heroes or peerless swordfighters can match. The only catch is that all this incredible destructive power hinges on how much Charlemagne has awakened to his innate kingly nature.",

The Roushigumi consisted of the Serizawa faction from the Mito clan, as well as the Kondo faction, which had been in power since the Shieikan. Alongside Hijikata Toshizo, Yamanami was appointed vice commander of the Kondo faction. The Roushigumi was recognized for its work, and was given a new name, the Shinsengumi, and their presence strengthened. However, the feud between the Serizawa and Kondo factions intensified, and the leadership of the Shinsengumi was eventually unified under Kondo's faction after the Serizawa faction was purged.\n\nYamanami assumed the position of secretary-general, next to Kondo as bureau chief, and Hijikata as vice commander. Yamanami played a central role in the Shinsengumi.

For the most part, she is indifferent to everyone except Master, though she may on occasion be thoughtful in cases of those she deems not to be her enemies. In consequence of the presence of certain elements of Athena within her, she is generally naive and her demeanor combines her typical demonic coldness with the emotional distance typical of gods.\n\nBut in truth, all of this is deliberate. She knows very well that if she is not careful, her emotions will come surging to the surface. It is for this reason that she keeps such a tight lid on her emotions. This, of course, and the presence of Athena. Because the scent of Athena is coming from her, she can feel her origin and her own demise at the same time, which irritates her. In other words, there is a part of her that is as young mentally as she appears on the outside.\n\nOn the other hand, she sometimes demonstrates maternal love for the golden sword she carries. When she is in a good enough mood, she even treats Master with a hint of maternal love (though she isn’t consciously aware of doing so).\n\n(First Ascension)\nHer younger mentality is emphasized, and she seems to wear her heart on her sleeve. She does not use honorifics and is not as tactful in her interactions. In this Ascension, she retains her focus on doing what she sees as her contracted job, though she is more forthcoming with questions and complaints. In her Second and Third Ascensions, that workaholic aspect of her tends to fade considerably. Medusa is not especially sociable and is very clear about who she likes and dislikes, making it difficult for her to form relationships. Her innate maternal instincts haven't changed either. Despite her brusque attitude, she cares about her sword and the monsters born from it. In fact, she may even try to include Master on the list of those deserving her protection if their relationship is sufficiently positive.",

For example, when Heracles brought back the hide of a Nemean lion, Thēseus drew a weapon, ready to attack the beast, while the other children fled in fear.\n\nThēseus is the son of King Aegeus of Athens, but because he was born when the king was out on a voyage, he grew up not knowing his father. Later, he obtained King Aegeus's sandal and sword after lifting the enormous rock under which they were hidden. He then decided to go on a treacherous journey in search of his father. While a journey across the sea would have been easier, a journey by land would be much more dangerous, made so by the many evils one would have to face and overcome. Thēseus believed taking the difficult route and destroying evil was his duty as a hero. And so he defeated Periphetes the bandit, Sciron, a Crommyonian Sow, and many other wicked people and monsters on his journey to Athens, where he ultimately reclaimed his birthright.",

She does not like violent men, but at the same time, she thinks they're cute because their behavior is childish.\nThat is why, when faced with a perfectly reasonable, reasoning person, she feels admiration (yearning) rather than fondness.\n\nShe values social mores and is generally polite. However, she is a realist and even a pessimist at heart, and so sometimes makes cutting remarks. She is patient, but the moment something goes awry, she will not stop until she gets a hold of the other person (to solve whatever issue)...like a runaway dump truck.\nIn that sense, she is like Shiki, who never hesitates in her decisions or actions.\n\nWhile her personality, actions, and way of speaking are feminine, her hobbies are far from girly. She enjoys watching horror movies and any other morbid activity done alone.\nShe may not realize this until the very end, but she is a latent sadist. This is the reason why she becomes cruel, merciless, and uncouth the moment she is cornered.",

After Tell expertly hit the apple and saved his son's life, Gessler asked why Tell hid a second bolt. Tell responded, \"If my first bolt hit something other than the apple, my second bolt was meant to kill you.\" This enraged Gessler and he arrested Tell, but Tell managed to escape en route to imprisonment.\n\nAnd so...in order to escape from the Vogt's revenge and to protect his sons from the Vogt's wrath, Tell did the only thing he could and was expected to do: he ambushed Gessler on horseback and shot a bolt through Gessler's heart.\n\nWith the tyrant gone, peace was restored to the town, and Tell was lauded as a hero.

It is that those who are beloved of the stars are also beloved of the gods (especially goddesses). Thus, his fate may have already been sealed at that point...point...point... (echoes)",

However, she and her army eventually fell in a campaign personally led by Emperor Aurelian, which put an end to Palmyra's resistance.

    "comment": "Born to Minamoto-no-Tameyoshi and a prostitute in the fifth year of Houen, A.D. 1139. As a child, his father, Tameyoshi, once said that Tametomo would grow up to be a renowned figure in Japan's western region of Chinzei, and that his skill with a bow would one day surpass that of his ancestors, and he was right. Even from a young age, it was clear to those around him that Tametomo was a gifted warrior.\n\nHowever, Tametomo often butted heads with his brothers, perhaps because they resented his talent. Eventually, his father sent him away to Kyushu in the west of Japan. There, Tametomo continued to make a name for himself in battle, and eventually became known as Chinzei Hachirou. Later, his father was relieved of his post as police and judicial chief for failing to respond to a summons from the Imperial Court. Tametomo, in turn, responded by raising an army of his own and riding out to Kyo to aid his father, only to get caught up in the Hogen Rebellion. He sided with the former emperor, along with his father, but ultimately lost the war. Tametomo's father was executed, and he himself was banished to Izu Oshima. However, not content with his banishment, he began conquering the neighboring islands for himself, which prompted the Imperial Court to send troops after him. Left with nowhere to run, Tametomo ultimately decided to take his own life.\n\nTametomo is said to have been 212cm tall, an exceptional height among the Japanese, especially for the time. Likewise, his bow is said to have been so taut that no ordinary person could hope to draw it on their own.",

However, by the time he was ready, the number of oni and monsters had dwindled so much that he was no longer necessary for that purpose, and was therefore sealed away before completion. It was not until many years later that his seal was broken and a new engineer filled in the missing parts to turn him into an anti-army warrior. However, it took so long to do so that the engineer ended up using a great deal of custom elements, the origins of which are no longer known. (Not that we know exactly where the technology for the Settsu Armor came from, either.)\n\nDespite his cold logic circuits, he is incredibly competitive and a dreadfully sore loser. He has no interest in authority, and cares only for proving his own might.

    "comment": "He came from the prestigious Takasugi family which had served the Mouri clan since the Sengoku era. Initially, he studied at the domain school Meirinkan, but its policy of only permitting samurai and its stiff classes didn't sit well with him, so he enrolled in Shokasonjuku, which was inherited by Yoshida Shouin, a former head of Meirinkan. Shokasonjuku, or rather Shouin's lectures, were apparently extremely interesting to him and he rapidly made a name for himself under Shouin's tutelage. He continued his studies in Edo, but when Yoshida Shouin was arrested and executed during the Ansei Purge, Takasugi began to openly speak of overthrowing the shogunate.\n\nTakasugi later joined the shogunate's delegation and traveled to Shanghai, where he witnessed firsthand the threat posed by Western powers. This deepened his concern for Japan's future and strengthened his resolve to overthrow the shogunate. After he returned to Japan, he was involved with political rallies where the popular phrase \"sonno joui\" (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians) was often chanted, interacting with other like-minded activists from various domains in Edo and Kyoto. Notably, he was known for his radical actions, including burning down the British legation.\n\nThe Choushu domain tried to put an end to Takasugi's reckless acts by offering him a position but Takasugi almost immediately quit. He did unbelievable things, like declaring he would just hang around for the next ten years. He also shaved his head... It was a mess. He said he was going away but was found playing the shamisen and reciting poems in his hometown. \n\nWhen the Choushu were crushed after their attempt to bombard the Americans, French, and Dutch, which rocked the Choushu to its core, for some reason they entrusted Takasugi with protecting Shimonoseki. Thus he established the modernized volunteer militia, which was known as the Kiheitai and did not limit its membership to specific social classes. After trouble of some manner, Takasugi was soon dismissed as general of the Kiheitai. Those damned domain folk...always nitpicking the littlest things. Anyway, after the Kinmon Incident, the Choushu domain became the Emperor's primary enemy. They were pretty sure they were all dead when four Western naval forces fought to control Shimonoseki. Unbelievably, the Choushu domain sent over the imprisoned Takasugi to initiate peace negotiations (possibly on a whim). However, in an even more unexpected turn of events, Takasugi's peace negotiations were successful. In a turn form the impressive to the outright absurd, he even forced payment of reparations upon the shogunate. In yet another crazy move, there is a story of Takasugi reciting the \"Kojiki\" out loud during a conference, all so he could pretend not to hear during the negotiations for the lease of Hikoshima Island.\n\nAs those crazy things were going on, the first Choushu expedition began, causing the Choushu domain to consider submission to the shogunate's requests. Takasugi, furious, took his ragtag little band to Kozan Temple in Shimonoseki to raise an army. Takasugi's move seemed rash but the excited momentum of Takasugi and his men had reached its peak. They headed for Hagi and wiped out the pro-surrender faction. This unified Choshu in support of overthrowing the shogunate. The shogunate sensed a change in the tide, which led to the second Choushu expedition. Everyone thought the Choushu were goners but, having already sampled the sweet taste of victory, they placed Takasugi in charge of the navy. Takasugi managed a great victory against the shogunate's fleet, ultimately causing the shogunate to lose authority, triggering the Taisei Hokan (Restoration of power to the emperor.)\n\nUnfortunately, Takasugi fell ill without ever seeing the nation restored to imperial rule. He died of tuberculosis.\n\n\"Damn. I had to kick the bucket when things were just about to get exciting.\"",

No matter how difficult the situation, she carries out every mission (protecting the forest) with dignity and determination. Because she is both aware and proud that she is stronger than other creatures, she is often prone to taking everything on herself, which may be her one shortcoming.\n\nShe may be a bit stodgy, but as she had a noble upbringing (which included an excellent education), is cultured enough to understand jokes, while also projecting a certain calm. However, she is not especially witty, nor is she gifted at lightening the mood with conversation, so she doesn’t usually tell jokes herself.\n\nShe goes into full maid mode when she's in her serving outfit and often takes the opportunity to make elegant jokes like, \"I can do that if I am a maid...\" She seems to like this side of herself for being able to be so lighthearted \n\n　　◆\n\nSaber Barghest was much more forthright when she was a warrior and speaking only for herself, whereas she was much more formal when speaking personally. However, summer Barghest's standpoint changes slightly with each Ascension.\n\nWhen she's in her ranger form, her excitement level is the same as in her warrior form, so her speech and manner are quite blunt. She may be a warrior when she's a Tam Lin, but because she wasn't forced to be a warrior, instead becoming one of her own volition, she's technically in her \"personal\" state.

In the southern isles?\"\n\n\"Perhaps High Queen Morgan actually meant this would be a foreign expedition.\"\n\nThose were the thoughts that swirled through Barghest's mind during the entire journey to Hawaltria. However, there were no enemies in the southern isles. Morgan built a luxury hotel in the western part of the island to enjoy a relaxing vacation. Additionally, the island was hosting some sort of festival called ServantFes. It was all so peaceful. Even the other Tam Lin were enjoying their summer break in their swimsuits.\n\n\"Swimsuits...white sands...seems fun... N-no, I mustn't let myself relax. I am High Queen Morgan's right hand. I am Tam Lin Gawain. I can't allow us to be vulnerable just because there are no enemies present!\"\n\nThus, uptight as she was, Barghest did not allow herself to wear a swimsuit to enjoy summer like the other Servants, and began to search for what she had to do the temporary garrison.\n\n　　◆\n\nThe reason she established the UDK was out of concern for the animals in the forest, but it was also to turn away from her own fate. The demonic dog Barghest that set cities ablaze and swallowed thunderclouds... In order to conceal that inconvenient truth, she distanced herself from the city and concentrated on fighting fires in the forest. Though she was encouraged to collaborate creatively with Chaldea, as well as some other notions from Morgan, she ultimately faced the demonic dog of her own volition and extinguished the flames in the city not as Tam Lin Gawain, but as Tam Lin Barghest.\n\n　　◆\n\nOne should take note of her attitude towards Master. To her, Master needs protecting in the tropics, but they are also colleagues when they work as a member of the UDK. Finally, when Barghest is wearing her maid outfit, she works diligently to ensure Master has the most comfortable vacation possible as a guest at Morgan's hotel.",

    "comment": "The nation-building hero Romulus who was previously bound by human limitations has now revealed their aspect as a god. Normally there is no possibility for a Divine Spirit to be summoned with a Grand Spirit Origin. However, the fact that they were deeply involved with human history and, in a most unusual exception, were elevated into a supreme god despite being human, were the miracles what enabled them to be summoned as a Grand Lancer in the Fifth Lostbelt.\n\nIn the Fifth Lostbelt, many of humanity's Heroic Spirits attempted to go up against Zeus, the Lostbelt King, but they were wiped out entirely. Entrusting their final hope to Chaldea, knowing that they would soon arrive, the Heroic Spirits gathered the last of their strength and left a grand plan behind to survive them.\n\nAnd so, \"Operation God Destroyer\" was conceived, leading to the summoning of Romulus=Quirinus, a Heroic Spirit/Divine Spirit who was on the side of humanity, and possessed a human aspect while simultaneously being the supreme god of myth, as well as power equivalent to the thunderbolt wielded by Zeus, the Greek king of gods.\n\nWith the arrival of Chaldea, Operation God Destroyer came to fruition. When Romulus=Quirinus manifested in the Lostbelt, they fought alongside Chaldea to successfully defeat the swarm of Olympus's divine mechs.\n\nWhen the mechanical gods were destroyed, Romulus=Quirinus disappeared along with them, and it was thought that they would never manifest ever again... But the bonds they formed with Master, combined with the Spirit Origin registering on to the Trismegistus in Novum Chaldea, enabled their Spirit Origin to be summonable without the Grand title. With their summoning, they can once again wield their arms like shining spears in defense of humanity.",

Yet, what she does is necessary for the world to continue. Just like water getting released from dams or the breath of a bud popping out from the ground, there are certain things in this world that cannot happen without first overcoming obstacles. She is the epitome of the notion that obstacles are a necessary evil to encourage evolution and growth.\n\nShe takes great pleasure in watching humans, and the world itself, grow through the hardships and obstacles she has prepared for them. This is not so much benevolence on her part as it is a...condescending, one-sided act in which she takes great pleasure. This is why she will neither hold back nor hesitate.\n\nShe may put up obstacles that appear to be absolutely evil, but she's not doing so from a desire for humanity to die off. Rather, she wants to see a stronger, more resilient world and people take control of the future. Bluntly, she's a top-tier sadist.

This compassionate, earnest personality remains the same as ever, making him well-suited for knighthood.\n\nMeanwhile, his faithful companion, Sancho, is as capable as maids come, doing everything in her power to grant her sir's wishes without losing her smile. She's also just as good at wrapping the knight around her little finger as she is at everything else. Although Don Quixote has sworn loyalty to his Master, and to conduct himself in a manner befitting a knight, Sancho's loyalties lie exclusively Don Quixote.\n\nHis First and Second Ascensions present him as the kind of ideal knight he always dreamed of becoming: proud, dignified, and with his beloved princess by his side. His Third Ascension, on the other hand, shows him for what he really is: a frail-looking old man who understands reality, yet still strives to be the knight he's so long aspired to become. But, unlike reality, Servants really do live in a world of dreams. And so, with Sancho prodding him along, he continues to summon up the courage in his old bones to face the giant we call \"reality.\"\n\nStrictly speaking, Sancho Panza on her own is more like a Phantom Spirit, but as a Servant, she encompasses Don Quixote's old horse, attendant, princess, and many other roles, all in a single ether body. As his attendant, she follows Don Quixote around like a country farmer or old horse. At other times, she gives him advice as the noble Princess Dulcinea, or expresses romantic feelings for him (or rather, pretends to, just like a certain Duchess ordered of Altisidora.)",

    "comment": "Penned by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes in the 17th century, \"Don Quixote\" is said to have sold more copies than any other novel in the world. In 2002, a group of writers from all across the world named it as the greatest work of fiction ever written. Its influence can be felt in countless works of art and music throughout history, and the name of its titular character has become widely understood shorthand for people with big, delusional dreams.\n\nIn the original book, Don Quixote is a poor fifty-year-old farmer who becomes so enamored with the idea of knighthood that he sells off the very land on which he's made his living for so long. In his madness, he truly believes he is the knight-errant he claims to be, which prompts him to set off on an adventure with his emaciated old horse, Rocinante, and his attendant, Sancho.\n\nOver the course of his adventure, he famously charges at a windmill he mistakes for a giant and finds himself chased off a farmer's land after treating the farmer's daughters as royalty. Later, a scholar and friend of his, Samson Carrasco, pretends to be a knight himself in hopes of bringing Don Quixote back to reality, only to have Don Quixote challenge him to a duel and win. But then, after Carrasco's wounds are healed, he comes back to his friend posing as a different knight and this time wins their duel. For the next year, Carrasco then brings Don Quixote back to their hometown so he may live a peaceful life.\n\nAs Carrasco predicted, Don Quixote reluctantly returns to their village. Unfortunately, the illness that cures him of his madness also gives him a fever that brings him to the brink of death. After suffering for six days, Don Quixote regains his original identity as Alonso Quixano, curses his attempt at knighthood as foolish nonsense, and dies without ever losing his most precious knightly possession: his innate humane goodness. And that is why, even to this very day, the world knows and loves this old knight.",

Though he initially did his best to make his way through Atlantis and reach Olympus alongside other heroic Servants, seeing Heracles vaporized robbed him of his will to fight. Sancho, seeing her sir terrified for his life, decided to use her Noble Phantasm to escape from Atlantis, only for them both to wind up in the Traum Singularity.\n\nUpon seeing the vast army of Servants revolting against humanity, Sancho then came up with a plan for them to survive by pretending to be Charles the Great and establishing the Righteous Realm. They then attempted to secretly gather like-minded Servants on Proper Human History's side and fight back against the other two realms. But, circumstances being what they were, gathering other Servants proved difficult, and it was clear that their current disadvantageous position was untenable. It was then that they found new allies in the Master of Chaldea and the Servants accompanying them, which helped them to renew their efforts to fight back against the Revenge and Reinstatement Realms.\n\nIncidentally, Don Quixote tried several times to apologize to the Master of Chaldea, but never found the time or the words, right up until he disappeared. Although Sancho believed, correctly, that there was nothing more they could have done on their own no matter how hard they tried, he still couldn't help but feel guilty for his actions, which contradicted the oaths of knighthood he swore. In the end, though, Don Quixote the Servant died in Traum as he lived: fighting side by side with Sancho, and holding always to his innate human goodness.",

To do this, she immolated Achilles's body in sacred flames in an attempt to burn away his impure human blood. In another version of this story, Thetis is said to have dipped Achilles in the river Styx.\n\nTo do this, though, would strip Achilles of his humanity entirely, so Peleus forbade Achilles from becoming completely immortal.\n\nThetis returned to her home, and Peleus, after careful consideration, entrusted Achilles to the sage Chiron for training. As Chiron was a good friend of Peleus, he was willing to take the boy on, and so Achilles began his training as a hero under the famed mentor, Chiron.\n\nA few years later, Achilles grew to be a proud young man. He eagerly joined in the Trojan war when recruited by the Achaeans.\n\nObviously, Achilles had no idea about the tragedy awaiting him in Troy.

Surprisingly, this decision was made a mere six weeks after Bartholomew was recruited.\n\nThough Bartholomew's debut as a pirate was a resplendent one, there was a time when an adjutant of his took off with a ship and goods.\nBecause of this incident, Bartholomew vowed to never let anything like this happen again and drafted a pirate code. He forced his subordinates to repeat the code and made them swear an oath on a Bible.\nThe pirate law included equal distribution of booty, no drinking after eight o'clock at night (which unfortunately was never followed as strictly), no gambling and other related restrictions, as well as guaranteed money in case a crew member gets injured during active pirating and needs to retire.\nAdditionally, he also allowed people from ships he captured who refused to become pirates to be released, despite the opposition of most of his crew.",

As the name suggests, Professor works as the ship's resident intellectual and strategist, and is in charge of analysis, calculation, and devising strategies.\n\nNemo Engineer\nThe stubborn chief engineer who runs the ship's engine room with a fierce workman's spirit. Hers is one of the most dangerous and demanding jobs on the ship and she is driven by her motherly love and belief that protecting humans is her duty. She also sees herself and Captain as equally ranked, and so thinks she can take his place if he ever screws up. She loves humanity a great deal, but loves the Nautilus just as much.\n\nNemo Nurse\nShe is in charge of the infirmary and is the most mature, as well as tolerant and rational, of all the Nemo Series. Nurse always performs her duties with a cool head in an emergency.\n\nNemo Baker\nBaker is the member of the Nemo Series in charge of the most important part of the ship: the galley (bakery). Meals boost a soldier’s morale, so ultimately this is the most powerful Nemo.",

The Noble Phantasm's sole and ultimate purpose is to protect Europa at all costs. Its durability is remarkable, and not even the gods can readily destroy it.

    "comment": "Habetrot of Faerie Britain\nShe makes her first appearance as the spinster faerie during a Fragment section of the story. She traveled alongside Aesc the Savior and helped to put an end to the many calamities plaguing Britain. When Mash Rayshifted to Fae Era 400 and met her, Habetrot's fate took a drastic turn...or rather, she did everything in her power to overcome her own destiny.\n\nWhen Aesc and the rest of the first Tam Lin disappeared from history, Habetrot wandered across Britain alone, spreading wedding culture and attending to numerous brides. Once the Era of the High Queen began, she turned herself into stone inside the Twisted Hole in northern Britain, where she fell into a deep slumber until her fateful encounter in 2019. After casually saving Mash at Sheffield, she guided Chaldea's Master to Orkney where she finally accepted the consequences of her choices.\n\nIn the Lostbelt, this faerie's name was originally Totorot. When Mash taught her the legend of Habetrot from Proper Human History, she decided to call herself Habetrot after she awoke from her stone slumber, in respect for Habetrot's way of life.\n\n　　◆\n\nTotorot was originally something of a hooligan of the Wing Clan, and she joined Aesc in her travels only after Aesc defeated her in a duel. (Though born as a faerie of thread-spinning, there were no human brides to tend to in the Lostbelt, forcing her to live without pursuing her purpose. This suffering twisted her into the brash hooligan she became.) After that duel, she fought alongside Aesc as one of the first Tam Lin.\n\nAdditionally, the Fragment story mentions that the name \"Mash\" was written on Mash's shield in chalk; this was Habetrot's doing. When Habetrot asked to look at the shield, she surreptitiously wrote Mash's name on it. The fact that chalk is commonly used to measure dimensions on cloth also shows that it was Habetrot.",

In short, Habetrot doesn't hate people.\n\nHer values are: peace is \"good because it's easy,\" while conflict is \"not good because it's tiresome.\" She's pretty much happy as long as she can keep on doing her needlework.\n\nThe Lostbelt Habetrot did not have the cultural familiarity with brides needed to fulfill her purpose, which caused issues with her memory capacity, but the original Habetrot is very intelligent despite her small stature.

Whenever she sees a girl she feels is the one (someone who has the potential to become a happy bride), she focuses all her energy into helping and supporting them. Habetrot refers to these girls as her brides. Once she sends off the bride, she goes in search for another. Even should she already have a bride in her care, if she finds another girl, she will devote herself to both, which has led some to say that Habetrot is prone to falling in love. She may not say it out loud, but Habetrot is a bundle of devotion. She is a self-sacrificing faerie who puts the happiness of her brides before her own.\n\n　　◆\n\nHabetrot values brides so highly because she can never mature. As much as she would like to be a bride herself, that wish cannot be granted. So she at least tries to protect the futures of those girls she deems beautiful enough to fall in love at first sight. Her protection of brides can be seen to some extent as living vicariously through them, or perhaps a dazzling dream... \n\n\"Maybe I can be like those girls someday.\"",

For example, Nastasia might have worried that her young and courteous husband would be hugely popular with other women were he to materialize, or it could be a simple case of Chaldea's summoning system malfunctioning in some way.\n\nWhile each hypothesis has some degree of possibility, there is no way to tell which, if any, may be true.

By the time Kōnstantînos XI ascended to the throne, the empire's territory had already been reduced to Constantinople and the area immediately surrounding the city; no power in such a precarious position could truly be called an empire.\n\nA distant descendant of Michael VIII Palaiologos, the founder of the Palaiologos dynasty (specifically, Michael's grandchild's grandchild's grandchild) Kōnstantînos XI and his family were powerless even to stop their palace from crumbling. Consequently, they were forced to live in a small, only barely habitable section. Some time after Kōnstantînos XI took the throne, the young sultan Mehmed II decided to take Constantinople for himself. However, Kōnstantînos XI rejected Mehmed's envoys when they demanded his surrender, sparking the beginning of Mehmed's desperate siege.\n\nKōnstantînos XI tried seeking aid and reinforcement from neighboring countries, but with hardly any both able and willing to send troops, he had to face the siege with only a few soldiers and mercenaries. He and his 7000 soldiers held the line against Mehmed's army of a hundred thousand for around two months thanks to his three-layer bulwarks, but in the end, Constantinople ultimately fell.\n\nPerhaps because Kōnstantînos XI waded into the battle himself with his trusty sword, his body's whereabouts remain unknown to this day.",

In the magecraft world, understanding a being's true name is essential to controlling it.\n\nEight Benevolences and Righteousnesses: A\nThese eight virtues are \"Jin\" (Benevolence), \"Gi\" (justice), \"Rei\" (courtesy), \"Chi\" (wisdom), \"Chu\" (loyalty), \"Shin\" (faith), \"Kou\" (piety), and \"Tei\" (respect), and are traditionally considered a crucial part of being a good person. The spirit beads that symbolize these virtues, each of which has the character for that virtue printed on it, flew off in eight directions after Fusehime died, and came to be possessed by each of the eight Dog Warriors from the day they were born. Eventually, once the Dog Warriors all came together, these mysterious beads then bestowed new power upon the goddess Fusehime.\n\nLost in Writing: A\nA skill that reflects the countless busy days Kyokutei Bakin spent absorbed in the act of creation.

    "comment": "Fusehime.\nA character in \"Nansou Satomi Eight Dog Chronicles.\" The eldest daughter of Satomi Yoshizane, the founder of the Awa Satomi clan and descendant of Nitta Genji. One day, her father jokingly says to Fusehime's pet dog, Yatsufusa, that he would offer Yatsufusa Fusehime's hand in marriage if only Yatsufusa would bring him back the head of a vexing enemy general. To their surprise, Yatsufusa did exactly that the very next day, prompting Fusehime to volunteer to hide away in a cave on Mt. To along with Yatsufusa in order to keep her father's promise. Over time, Fusehime becomes pregnant from Yatsufusa's spiritual energy, and ends up taking her own life to prove her chastity to her father.\n\nUpon her death, Buddhist prayer beads wreathed in spiritual energy that she wore everywhere she went flew off in eight directions, coming to reside in the bodies of eight dog warriors with ties to the Satomi clan. From then on, Fusehime became the guardian goddess of the Satomi clan, though she protected them from the shadows.\n\nIn Japanese, she uses the highly unusual \"wanami\" as her pronoun for herself. A proud, daring, and righteous woman who refuses to tolerate any wrongdoing, her physical age serves as the base for Kyokutei Bakin's Servant form.\n\nYatsufusa.\nAnother character in \"Nansou Satomi Eight Dog Chronicles.\" An exceptionally large dog who was raised by tanuki, he adores Fusehime with all his heart. Mistakenly taking Satomi Yoshizane's jest about marrying his daughter as having been made in earnest, he hurried off to bring back an enemy general's head and ultimately returned victorious.\n\nAlthough the lingering grudge of former enemies dwelled within his body, he was able to overcome it thanks to Fusehime's sutra readings. Though he unfortunately died of a wound from a stray bullet, in death, he remained by Fusehime's side as her faithful spirit dog.",

It's similar to Ushiwakamaru's \"The Wandering Tales of Shana-oh.\" As a Servant, Huang Feihu is able to borrow powers from those who helped him during this incident, his family members in particular.\nThe following happened at one of the checkpoints called Tong Pass:\nThe checkpoint was guarded by General Chen Tong, a former subordinate of Huang Feihu who also held a grudge against him. Chen Tong and Huang Feihu locked spears, and Feihu had the advantage. Chen Tong realized he couldn't win, so he fled and flung his Fire Dragon's Dart projectile—granted to him by a sage—at the pursuing Huang Feihu. Huang Feihu fell from his divine ox, and by the time his companions came to his side, he was already dead. While his family grieved, Feihu’s eldest son, Huang Tianhua, arrived to save his father. Missing since the age of three, Tianhua had trained under Daode Zhenjun for the past thirteen years. Using medicinal elixirs given by Daode Zhenjun, Huang Feihu was brought back to life. Tianhua later learned his mother and aunt were killed by King Zhou and became enraged, confronting Chen Tong together with his father. During the battle against Chen Tong, Tianhua absorbs the Fire Dragon Dart into a mysterious flower basket, and manages to cut Chen Tong's head using the Sword of Mo Ye, another gift from Daode Zhenjun.\nMo Ye is a treasured sword from the mountain where Daode Zhenjun resided; a Baobei that is powerful enough to cut off a person's head from the light it emits. As a Servant, Huang Feihu is able to borrow and wield the sword as his Noble Phantasm, just like in legend, because it is originally his son Huang Tianhua's possession.\n\nAs a side note, it's unknown how this sword relates to another blade bearing the Mo Ye name—known in Japanese as Bakuya.",

    "comment": "Character in FGO\nHe is the head of his family and loyal warrior who values family bonds. However, he is constantly haunted by the thought of what true loyalty is. While he abandoned Shang after his wife and sister were murdered, Feihu is constantly depicted in the stories to be hesitant and lost even while he conquers the checkpoints on his way to join the Zhou army.\nHe knew logically that King Zhou was the rightful monarch of the Shang dynasty, and as a family member who loyalty served the dynasty for seven generations, he questioned whether his abandonment was just. He also knew King Zhou's many atrocities and that the murder of his wife and sister were rightfully inexcusable, yet he wondered whether that warranted him abandoning his position as the king's retainer.\nTaigong Wang and others constantly reinforced Feihu, saying that the king sealed his own fate through his evil and treacherous acts, causing the heart of his people to distance themselves from the king, including his retainer. Huang Feihu accepted that justification and fought with the Zhou army, yet deep down he continued to question what was right and honorable as a warrior.\nAs a Servant manifested in Chaldea, Huang Feihu realizes that those lingering thoughts have not disappeared, but rather have become more pronounced. It is understandable, as a Servant can't choose their own Master. There is no guarantee that the Master before him would not be perilous like King Zhou... If that were the case, what should Huang Feihu do? What would be the right thing to do?\nThe warrior who believes family is the most important thing in the world is constantly conflicted with such uncertainty, and carefully watches Master to determine which type they will turn out to be.",

Instead, she is egotistical, shortsighted, and is perfectly comfortable with her role of high school girl. However, because in her heart of hearts she enjoys serving those around her, there are times when behavior that may seem on its face to be egotistical is in fact an act of goodwill to another.\n\nSuzuka Gozen feels more liberated in a swimsuit and, though there may be some room for error, she is a little more egocentric in her thinking than her Saber self. Also, were she to become a Santa, her tendency to serve those around her would certainly be more prominent.\n\nMotivation, behavior towards Master (Part 1)\nSuzuka Gozen's goal is to fall in love and to improve herself and pursue beauty in preparation for love. In other words, the swimsuit Spirit Origin is perfect for her. This is an opportune time to show off her liberated side far more than usual, and the goal is to monopolize everyone's gaze at the beach. The competition (read: other swimsuit Servants) may pose a challenge, but don't lose hope, Suzuka!\n\n...Well, her motivation may be the same as in her Saber form, but there's one big condition when in a swimsuit:\n\n\"To seriously enjoy summer.\"\n\nThat means love and self-improvement were all included in the spell of summer. In anticipation of love, she spends her summer days with her friends. Even if she does not find love, Suzuka Gozen will likely accept it as another sparkling, precious summer memory.",

That is all.\nHope, hope, and more hope. So long as they have hope in their hearts, people can continue on, overcoming fear and adversity of any sort. At least, the clothing gives the wearer cause to believe so.\n\nBut creating clothing of that caliber can also be very draining to the creator. Once her masterpiece clothes your form, you are bound to realize: ah, she has flown away, beyond the sunset, leaving a memento of herself...",

    "comment": "There are numerous stories about animals repaying favors. They are stories of birds and beasts who are saved by human beings, and they later bring fortune to the human as a way of returning the good deed. One of the most prominent stories in Japan of this type is the \"Crane Returns a Favor\" story.\n\nMiss Crane's existence is based on the crane from that story. A crane devotes herself to working to repay her savior; she weaves on a loom using feathers she pulled from her own body to use in her work. Should someone see her at work, she transforms into her crane form and leaves the scene. What's different from the folktale is that she is able to keep going by creating clothes using the fabric she weaved. This trait is unique to her appearance here.\n\nHer manifestation occurred under unusual circumstances, and she's traveled around the world. During her travels, she met many people (including some Servants) and they helped her in many ways. She has never forgotten those deeds, and she vowed that she would return all their favors one day.\n\nOne day, someone offered her a piece of bread.\nAnother time, someone offered her a warm bed to sleep on.\nAnother, someone offered her front-row seat tickets to a concert.\nShe has never once forgotten any of those deeds.\n\nI shall return all those favors. I will repay them all. Of course for YOU, too.",

However, perhaps thanks to her natural acumen for sealing, she managed to grow up into a strong, good-natured woman, without any lingering trauma.\n\nOne day, a fellow shrine maiden and friend of hers unwittingly undid the seal restraining an evil god, who then went on to kill everyone in her village in a single night. As the sole survivor, Okuni dedicated her life to tracking the god down, and traveled all around Japan in her pursuit. Sadly, she never accomplished her goal during her life, and her regret in failing to do so became a core part of who she is as a Heroic Spirit.\n\nFortunately, she was given another chance to exorcize the god, and this time, she was successful.

    "comment": "Wu Zetian's newly rediscovered capacity for Taoist arts gives rise to an inherent contradiction: Why was she afraid of spirits all this time? The truth is, when she was alive, her Taoist arts didn't work; they had no effect at all. No matter how many times she chanted, the ghosts of those she had poisoned still plagued her, and cats still looked down at her with spite in their eyes. Small wonder, then, that she could not make use of Taoist arts when she had seen for herself how poorly they worked. This trauma tremendously complicated the prospect of her becoming a Caster, which was necessary to stabilize her swimsuit Spirit Origin. Scáthach-Skadi's solution to this problem was to employ her runes to seal away Wu Zetian's memories of her failures with Taoist arts.\n\nNow that she is able to trust her own abilities, the newly swimsuited Wu Zetian appears (emphasis on appears) to have forgotten all about her fear of the undead. This, however, is owed entirely to her being able to deal with spirits meaning there is no reason for her to fear them. Once summer ends and she once more recalls how completely ineffective her arts were, or, alternatively, if she ever begins to worry about the possibility of encountering a righteous ghost she is unable to exorcise even in her new Spirit Origin, her experiences from this summer will vanish as though waking from a dream.\n\nThat's right. Deep down, in her heart of hearts, she still feels as though she can never escape the spirits cursing her for all the political assassinations she enacted, whether or not she did so for the greater good of China. However, that is not weakness. This feeling stems from her pride in protecting her country, and in spite of her fears, she would do it all again if she had to.\n\nAnd so, naturally, hard worker that she is, Wu Zetian continues to try to overcome her fear of spirits (and cats) even after summer draws to a close...",

Fearing condemnation from Avalon le Fae, the other clans formed an alliance and invaded Orkney. Orkney was put to the torch, the entire Rain Clan was slaughtered, and Avalon le Fae, who was being sheltered there, was discovered and executed. The \"Avalon le Fae\" they captured was actually the Queen of Orkney's real daughter, who risked her life out of concern for Morgan's future.\n\nFollowing the Rain Clan's final act of resistance, which insured her survival, Morgan swallowed her hatred for the other clans and set off from Orkney to mainland Britain to fulfill the Rain Clan's wish of making Britain a peaceful land free of conflict. However, by the time she reached the mainland, her sadness over losing Orkney embittered her, leaving her cold and dead-eyed.\n\n\"Other than those from the Rain Clan, I hate all faeries. I will work to eradicate conflict from Britain, but that does not mean I wish for all faeries to be happy. If you seek my help, it will cost you more than your life.\"\n\n...She was carrying on like the archetypal evil witch of so many fairy tales. However, after a thousand years of traveling, she found friends and comrades she could trust, along with a clear goal for herself, which led her to abandon her evil witch façade. In truth, this came as a relief, because her behavior was rather forced.\n\nThe story of Aesc the Witch ends here, where the story of Aesc the Savior begins.",

    "comment": "Huyan Zhou Who Fused with a Phantom\nA compound Servant developed by Moriarty and Bael in Shinjuku. They intended to create a Servant that combined the shape-shifting abilities of Hecate's child (or the alter ego of Hecate herself) with one of the top attackers from \"Water Margin,\" Huyan Zhuo, as well as to reinforce Empusa's weak mental state.\n\nYet, despite using Huyan Zhou as base material, this mental frailty could not be overturned. Her combat skills may have been spectacular, but Moriarty determined her as a failure and favored Yan Qing, who had successfully merged with a doppelganger.\nSo how did this rejected data come about? This probably happened due to Csejte or Elly's strange powers or whatnot, and led to Huyan Zhuo's summoning...or something like that.\n\n\"What do you mean, 'whatnot!?' Wouldn't that be the most important part!? And saying 'or something like that' totally sounds like an afterthought!\"\n\nIn her first Ascension form, she acts like a cool and composed assassin, but her true colors quickly show up once she goes through Ascension. During the Csejte Mount Liang incident, she headed out into battle as an official. She tries to take down Mount Liang in order to satisfy her need for approval by receiving praise from Master (or rather, their alter ego)...\n\n...The sky is clear. All light shine towards Mount Liang.\nThis is a record that proves that even the most hopeless of villains can save the world.",

    "comment": "Tezcatlipoca has been defined in the Aztec world as an omnipotent god. In some respects, this makes him a mixture of the Norse god Odin, the Greek god Zeus, the Buddhist Demon King of the Sixth Heaven (Mara), and Satan (Lucifer) of Christianity. While such gods (or devils) are unrivalled in the material world, they are not so invincible in the spiritual world. They are similar in that they are nigh-omnipotent, but nonetheless limited.\n\nWhile Tezcatlipoca's name is known in Japan, there are surprisingly few mythological accounts of him. Not only does he lack the more human personality of Greek deities, he has left no mark on human society like Japanese deities. In many ways, he is more like a system, inciting conflicts throughout the world and defining their outcome. It would seem that this is the sort of deity he is.\n\nHowever, the standards by which such outcomes are defined are unclear. It is believed that Tezcatlipoca himself is indifferent to this aspect. The extent of his involvement is a roll of the dice. In this way, he resembles the many deities of destiny in other mythologies who are unable to truly bend fate itself to their will.",

He tends to prattle on and has a habit of warning others about what they lack in idle conversation.\n\nStrict with others. Generous to himself. (Because his nature can change on the spot, he can't possibly be strict with himself.) At his core, he is a pessimist who darkens the atmosphere and has an innate lack of luck, and so invites even more demanding situations. Consequently, he is treated as though he is a grim reaper. His demeanor is indifferent and ruthless, but the conversationalist in him makes him quite likeable.\n\n\"First, you'll face the worst-case scenario. Fight and win, even if you have to die trying. A reward awaits you beyond the battle. Though, if we're talking net profit, you'll come out just a little ahead.\"\n\nHis cruel personality leads him to tirelessly search out seeds of war. He enjoys cultivating them and watching them bloom. This makes him seem like a warmonger or an arms dealer who gives weapons to two city-states to help ignite their inevitable conflict all the faster. There is no malice in this action, however. To Tezcatlipoca, the fight for existence itself is order. He sees it as a cyclical good which stabilizes the world.\n\nTezcatlipoca is intrigued by the wars of the nineteenth to twenty-first centuries, and is fond of modern personal weaponry from the year 2017, seeing such things as \"nice toys.\" He also holds them in high regard, as they are the very weapons the conquistadors used to defeat the Aztec Empire. But he is embarrassingly clumsy with them and resorts to using brutish axes, jaguar claws, and supernatural phenomena as his weapons. Point this out to him, however, and you'll hurt his feelings.\n\n\"I don't hate the Japanese. They're a remarkably circumspect people.

The subterranean underworld Mictlān is conflated with Xibalba, the underworld of Mayan mythology. This Noble Phantasm fuses Tezcatlipoca's Authority as the ruler of Mictlānpa, the paradise of rest, and his era as the first sun in the sky. He controls all physical laws of the earth's surface and can force creation to comply with the laws he decides, but he is also bound by those same laws. The only traces of the era of the first sun—when the now-extinct giants roamed the earth—remain in the underworld. Thus, the act of Tezcatlipoca regaining his power, or expressing it on Earth, is necessarily equivalent to manifesting the underworld itself upon Earth's surface.\n\n　　◆\n\nMesoamerica is an unforgiving world and humanity is believed to have faced countless catastrophes there. For this reason, Mesoamerican people believed that the world they live in now did not always exist, holding that it was preceded by another long ago. Conversely, even if the world were to be destroyed, some aspect of it will remain to be inherited by the next world. They fervently believed that the world would recover even after its destruction. \n\nThe clearest expression of this belief is the Five Suns tradition describing five apocalypses. Tezcatlipoca led one of these five doomsdays. He also engaged in a dialogue with Quetzalcoatl during the fifth apocalypse, which regenerated the world and stabilized the current world of Aztec mythology.\n\nTezcatlipoca is misunderstood as the god of death and war. In fact, most Aztec gods are death gods. Thus, it is not he in particular who threatens the world and demands human death and sacrifice. In fact, he preserves the rules of the Mesoamerican world (the importance of sacrifices as valuable tributes stabilize the world), while Quetzalcoatl threatens it (attempting to destroy the existing order by insisting that sacrifices are unnecessary).",

It was a product so extraordinary that all who beheld the sculpture believed it alive, the creator himself fell in love with it, and even a god deemed it worthy of the breath of life. It was this chisel that produced a sculpture that was beyond human wisdom.\nThis Noble Phantasm is imbued with Aphrodite's blessing, and anything that gets carved out will begin to move, recreating the legend of Pygmalion.

All of these objects become both a statue and a life form, just like Galatea (as far as its color and texture). \nHowever, the objects do not live forever, and will turn back into intricate sculptures when Galatea runs out of magical energy. Also to note: humans cannot be created into life, no matter how intricately carved.

The powers Galatea uses during battle originates from Aphrodite's divinity, but Galatea is not aware that her lineage can be traced back to Aphrodite, and she only thinks of Aphrodite as a goddess who still gives her protection. \nGalatea considers Aphrodite a goddess she's greatly indebted to, and as a wonderful goddess of love who continues to offer her blessing even now.\n\nWhy would Aphrodite, who thrives from uninhibited love, do something like this in the first place? It's not entirely clear, but Aphrodite is said to have two epithets: Pandemos, the aggressive part of her that rules mortality, and Urania, the side that rules pure love. It is assumed that the latter aspect was affected by King Pygmalion's earnest love which led to these actions being taken.",

Perhaps this is because Chaldea is a very different environment from a typical Holy Grail War.\n\nHowever, she can't seem to help acting in a blunt, almost standoffish manner towards Siegfried. She consistently gives her once beloved husband the silent treatment, cites people with his exact personality as one of her most hated things, and glares resentfully at him when she thinks no one else is looking. This is all because, right before she killed him, Hagen told her that Siegfried had died because he himself had chosen to. Understanding now that the very man she swore revenge for was also the one responsible for his death, she has no choice but to pass the days grinding her teeth in frustration, as she knows she can't try to kill him now.\n\nIn general, she sees her Master as no more than a mobile supply of magical energy. However, if, as her Master, you can deepen your bond with her enough, she will recognize you as a kindred soul and include you in her plans for revenge. But be warned, if you deepen your bond with her any further, she will suddenly start giving you the cold shoulder once again.

Perhaps this is why her realm is the only one to receive special support in the form of the pale red sky. Though undoubtedly mad, Kriemhild was also nothing if not exceedingly rational. She refused to tolerate traitors or weaklings, and was quick to execute them with her husband's demonic sword.\n\nWhile the Master of Chaldea was of course the primary reason she sees Chaldea as her enemy, it also didn't hurt that Siegfried was so clearly on the side of Proper Human History.\n\nThere were two reasons Kriemhild didn't make a move to overwhelm the other realms with sheer numbers and take them for herself. The first was that she knew any attempts to invade the other realms would be too risky for her tastes, given the quality of soldiers she had to work with (despite how ruthlessly focused she was on revenge, she was also a calm and clearheaded commander). The second was that she wanted to achieve the revenge she tried and failed to take once before. She was strangely certain that, if Proper Human History continued to function as it should, it would not fail to summon HIM to deal with the threat she posed.\n\nAnd indeed, her wish came true. The vengeful princess of legend was, in fact, able to face off against her legendary dragon-slayer husband. As for what happened after their fierce, tempestuous battle, well...that hardly need be said.

His mother was blessed by a sage, promising she would birth one hundred children. In actuality, though, she gave birth only to a single lump of flesh. The sage then divided the flesh into one hundred pieces and placed them in jars. From these, her one hundred sons were born.\n\nDuryodhana was constantly in conflict with the Pandavas, even conspiring with his uncle to trick the five brothers in the rigged gambling scheme that led to their banishment from their own kingdom. Even after their period of exile ended, Duryodhana did not allow the five brothers to return, ultimately leading to the great Kurukshetra War.\n\nDuryodhana was a great warrior and master of the mace, whose skill was recognized even by Krishna. However, he was finally defeated by Bhīma in a duel. He left everything in Aśvatthāman's hands when he died.",

    "comment": "The eldest son of the Pandava, Yudhiṣṭhira, was wise and virtuous, and he was favored to be the next king. This was why Duryodhana regarded the five brothers, especially Yudhiṣṭhira, with disdain. He tried many times and with many schemes to take down the brothers. In one such effort, he tried to assassinate Bhīma, the second of the Five Princes, and he ordered the houses of the Five Princes built from flammable materials, intending to burn them all down. However, ultimately each of his schemes failed.\n\nAt a large martial arts exhibition, performed before the royal family, Duryodhana was filled with envy and hatred when Arjuna and his men gave an especially outstanding performance. That was when Karna stepped forward and challenged Arjuna to a showdown. The superb skill displayed by Karna diminished the excitement of the Five Princes, and Duryodhana was delighted to see Karna shooting them down. Karna further requested a duel with Arjuna, but the duel was disallowed because of the difference in status between the two, as Arjuna was royalty. Duryodhana objected to the decision, and said he would personally give the title of king to Karna. This brought Karna and Duryodhana close as brothers, and so later, Karna sided with the hundred princes during the great war.",

When Duryodhana, who had been invited to the ceremony, arrived, he was overwhelmed by the ceremony's lavishness and was once again driven mad with envy after being humiliated several times at the proceedings. He conspired with his uncle Śakuni to take everything from the Five Princes in a game of dice. The plan exploited Yudhiṣṭhira's weakness for gambling. The scheme was a success, resulting in the Five Princes losing everything. The brothers lived in a forest for twelve years, and they were then forced to live in anonymity for another year.\n\nThe brothers returned on the fourteenth year, which led to the eruption of the great Kurukshetra War.",

Regardless, they fought in the great war of myth in ancient times. To a one, they are warriors who learned martial arts just like the Five Princes and Duryodhana. They demonstrate a high level of coordination through their blood relationship, and they can smash through most opponents with sheer weight of numbers.\n\nAdditionally, the personalities of the one hundred princes are pretty similar to Duryodhana, with only slight differences.

However, in later ages, she and her mother Themis (with whom she is sometimes conflated), and Justitia from Roman mythology were given a different name and attendant significance.

Caren transforms not into Amor, but the heavenly love at his source, delivering an attack of divine wrath that illuminates the world with unconditional and infinite love. Anyone can see that it's an anti-world Noble Phantasm, but its user insists that it's meant to be used against people. Caren's idea of love applies unconditionally to all of mankind. It is the purely selfless love of a god; it is agape.\n\nOnce upon a time, in tiger colosseum, Caren wielded a morning star named \"My Weight Is Equal to My Wielder's Love.\" Caren loves all of humanity, ergo her hammer is as heavy as Earth, at least for the FGO edition.\n\nThe love beams are the infinite part, and it's unconditional because Caren generously won't charge you a fee for getting blasted.\n\nShroud of Valentinus: A\nEros (erotic love). This was originally Caren's trusty Shroud of Magdala, but she's now using it as a \"shroud of lovers.\" Apparently, she named it after Valentinus to play along with the holiday spirit at Chaldea.\n\nGolden Arrow: A\nPhilia (friendly love).\nAngelic arrows that Amorize human hearts they pierce. Forcefully.\n\n\"Love always comes as a surprise, doesn't it?\"\n\nMana Burst (Love): A\nStorge (filial love) aka God Caren. A super-buff called forth for the singular one she loves and must protect.

    "comment": "Rather than Fate/hollow ataraxia...this is Caren from Fate/tiger colosseum. The girl dispatched as a Church Overseer was taciturn and spoke nothing of her own opinions and circumstances, but this time, freed from the duties of a sister, she's taken on the attitude of something more like a mastermind, freely talking, working, and scheming. (A mastermind she may be, but she's only working to create happiness for all, rather than acting out of any malice.)\n\n...That said, Caren sure does have a troublesome personality, being as much of a masochist as she is a sadist. She loves seeing people suffer, and loves her own physical suffering. That's why she plans out better lives for people, but prepares harsh trials before any can reach those ends.\n\nCaren approves of generating revenue, but only so she can use those funds as a symbol of authority or to control people. After all, people wish for God's love and dominion. To Caren, who occasionally becomes one with God's will during fervent prayer (according to her), earning money will lead to greater joy for all.\n\nThe Church teaches that it is wrong to hoard worldly wealth, but Caren does not consider money to be wealth, and cares little for the currency she gathers. She is simply excited by the act of accumulating money; she has no thoughts of buying nice things with that money, nor using it to live in luxury. It seems that to her, it is merely a resource to be spent.\n\n　　　◆\n\nWhile she has offered herself to any number of people and animals to exorcise their demons, thinking always of their happiness...she has only ever felt pure, human love—wishing someone else happiness for her own sake—for one person. Even now, the memories and wishes of that time are buried deep within her heart.",

In the time leading up to that, he met with Kriemhild, Kōnstantînos XI, and Pope Johanna, and encouraged them to continue waging a deadly war between their respective realms. Moriarty had multiple goals in this Singularity, one of which was to make a complex situation even more complex (particularly focusing on the kind of complexity Moriarty was personally quite fond of). \n\nFirst, to arrange a stage on which to kill Sherlock Holmes once and for all.\nSecond, to sow further chaos throughout the Singularity and prevent the Foreign God from suspecting his true motives.\nAnd finally, to leave Chaldea so desperate, they would turn to him as their savior.\n\nThis is why he first acquired the essences of the three Norse goddesses of fate: Urdr, Verdandi, and Skuld. Thanks to their ability to measure and spin threads of fate, he was able to nullify all attacks directed at him by declaring it was not his fate to be injured, and to remove all obstacles in his way by declaring it was his fate to overcome them. However, as Mash pointed out, even this power has a weakness: if used to overcome your fate in a dramatic fashion, it punishes you with significant and unavoidable debuffs. After all, defeating your archrival as the protagonist in your own tale inevitably means bringing your tale to an end, which in turn means you can no longer be the protagonist. This is why Holmes agreed to challenge Moriarty one-on-one; he hoped to more dramatically raise the story's stakes, as it were. Were it not for Holmes's loss, Chaldea might never have been able to defeat Moriarty.\n\nIn the end, Moriarty and his Spirit Origin vanished into the ether, but not before leaving behind one last unbelievable mystery.",

The chaos only subsided when Iyo became Yamataikoku's second queen. While Iyo ruled the nation well, doing things like paying tribute to the emperor of the Jin dynasty, her leadership and strength as a shrine maiden were not a match for Himiko, and Yamataikoku slowly started down the path to ruin.\n\n\"That makes it sound like everything was my fault, but it wasn't...! It was all because Himiko was all... Waaah! I'm sorry!\"\n\nRather than solving her problems with brute force like Himiko, Iyo excels in manipulating sophisticated and delicate magical energy. The splendid Yamataikoku's queen's kicking techniques were also said to have been popular among the people.\n\n\"Bad people who won't listen to me will get a good kicking!\"\n\nAre we just talking about the difference between a punch and a kick?",

    "comment": "Himiko may have been mysterious, but Iyo's origins are even more so. Originally, Iyo was a shrine maiden of the Kunakoku, a hostile nation opposed to Yamataikoku. She was considered a shrine maiden of destruction from birth and was raised as a sacrifice to Kukochihiko, a sorcerer of the Kunakoku. However, during the war between Kunakoku and Yamataikoku, Iyo's talents were discovered by Himiko, who took Iyo on as an apprentice. In addition to the spells she learned from Kuna, Iyo learned kidou from Himiko, amplifying her inherent talents. While serving as the disciple of Himiko, who controlled the power of light, she became the shrine maiden who wielded the power of darkness. Her great talents amazed even Himiko, but she was averse to her own powers, and so Iyo was unable to make full use of her skills.\n\n\"Using out-of-this-world powers like Himiko is not my style... But I should be able to compensate with my skills and technique... Anyway, let's just leave it at that!\"",

A beast's soul is incorporated into a human so they can gain power. It's a dangerous spell that can turn one into a beast if used too often.\n\nPrimitive Limbs: B\nFlexible and beautiful limbs. A magnificent, vital body possessed by primitive humans. A slender body. Wiry legs which execute stunning and powerful kicks. As she is not powerful as Himiko, she compensates with technique.

But this was no arbitrary shunning. Iyo truly DID possess the power of destruction Her power could destroy everything around it just by her presence alone. The moment Iyo was born, that power was said to be the doom of her parents, her clan, and eventually a nation. She spent her days despairing over the powers she was cursed with. In time, she gave up on everything, and was content simply to sink to the bottom of the earth from the dark stone chamber where she was kept.\n\nBut then, a single light burst into being, blinding and warm.

As her original personality was submissive to begin with, she has become more like the girl BB was based on after her change of heart.\n\nLip is aware that she is an extremely dangerous and troublesome Servant. Because of that, she is grateful to her Master for remaining by her side nonetheless.\nSuch feelings of gratitude eventually change into deep affection and adoration, and ultimately she will believe herself to be in love.\n...Yet, since Lip is very aware of her qualities and background, she is no longer able to innocently pursue love.\nIf she falls in love...if she acts on her love, she will hurt this kind person. That's why she is going to simply continue to dream, and continue to support her Master.",

Protea is constantly ashamed of herself, since she is aware that she is a waste byproduct.\n\nShe has no interest in the outside world nor other humans, and simply seeks for Master's love. Calling it an innocent advance or blind devotion sounds nice and all, but in reality, it's a dangerous relationship, like walking a tightrope. Protea does not love Master because she has feelings for them, but simply because Master loves her, which shows that Protea only knows love without understanding true feelings of endearment and closeness. Should Master's affection run out, she will cease to feel love, and she will quickly become unsatisfied. Should that ever happen, Protea won't be able to endure her thirst for love, and will devour Master.\n\nUltimately, Protea is just like any of the other Alter Egos, born with a twisted sense of self.

In order for that to happen, Masters who form a contract with Kingprotea will need to further develop her mental state and essence as a being.

Unlike Abe-no-Seimei, who belonged to the Onmyou Bureau, Ashiya Douman was a priest, and considered to be part of the opposition to the government.\n\nInitially Seimei and Douman cooperated with each other, but at some point Douman came to loathe Seimei and the Onmyou Bureau, and they began to disagree on every issue. During the Heian period of Japan, where divinity was rampant, the clash between two of their discipline was surely intense. Additionally, if one were to take the legends about Douman seriously, that would mean Douman must have died numerous times. For this game, it is assumed that Ashiya Douman mastered the secret art of Hakudou Jyonin, and had already attained a type of pseudo-immortality during his lifetime.",

According to myth, he often blessed brave warriors with items such as these. To Lugh, he gave Fragarach and the boat; to Cú Chulainn, he gave a magical helmet; and to Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, he gave a magical spear.\n\nIn general, Manannan loves humans as much as the sea that provides them with countless bounty. This is why, when he sensed the impending crisis facing humanity, he decided to materialize as a Servant in a compatible vessel: Bazett. He became an Alter Ego because Bazett possesses only a fraction of his true power and an isolated fragment of his consciousness.\n\nIn general, Manannan is still much the same being he was when he lent magical items to brave warriors. The only difference now is that instead of lending an item, he's lending a part of himself. While he was a bit surprised to find that his vessel was such an awkward woman, what's done is done.

One was a Japanese god of tenmoku (a kind of dark ceramic glaze that resembles oil spotting) and the other was a Chinese god of agriculture (the immortal emperor of grains). However, she only incorporated a part of their abilities, so it's really more like she borrowed their power rather than making it her own.

There are numerous regions throughout Japan to which Xu Fu is said to have given something of great importance (ironworking, pharmaceuticals, ceramics, etc.), and these legends are still celebrated today in various Japanese shrines.

She once served Qin Shi Huang, but her driving motivation changed on the day she happened to meet Yu Mei-ren. Xu Fu soon fell head over heels to Yu Mei-ren's charms, and when she learned how much trouble Yu Mei-ren's immortality was causing her, Xu Fu decided to find a way to kill her and put her out of her misery. It was actually for this reason that she asked Qin Shi Huang to send her on a search for the elixir of immortality.\n\nUpon arriving in Japan, she built a settlement and quickly got to work. Although Xu Fu is a first-class Taoist practitioner capable of creating lifelike dolls for human testing and memory-erasing Bounded Fields, she was still unable to arrive at an immortal killing solution in her own time, and had to entrust her work to be carried on by later generations. After continuing their research for almost two thousand years, the settlement itself withered away, with Xu Fu's goal still unmet.\n\nSome time later, Xu Fu was summoned as a Servant and created a Singularity centered around her old settlement. Yu Mei-ren was part of the team who came to the Singularity to repair it, though she had no idea that Xu Fu was working behind the scenes to try and finally complete her immortal slaying solution...\n\nAnd so, for one sweet summer, Xu Fu's dream of killing an immortal ironically gained new life.",

    "comment": "■Historical Facts & Persona\nGrigori Rasputin was a mystic who was active in late Imperial Russia. Born to a farmer, the previously unheard-of mystic spread religious teachings among the people, amassed followers, and eventually gained the trust of the tsar, becoming involved in his nation's downfall. His eccentric appearance, rumors swirling around him, and miracle-working gained him a far-reaching reputation as a wondrous mystic.\n\nRasputin's healing of Tsarevich Alexei, legitimate heir to Tsar Nicolai II, was the act that cemented his relationship with the imperial household. The aristocracy shunned him for the influence he gained over national politics. The clergy ostracized Rasputin for his ignoble birth and wild affairs with his female disciples, and rumors claimed he was using the imperial family for his personal gain. He had many enemies, but Rasputin never wavered from his personal convictions or way of life.\n\nAlthough Rasputin has been held partly responsible for the dissolution of the Russian Empire, he strongly opposed military conflict with Germany prior to the First World War. Even after war broke out, he remained a pacifist, making him a nuisance to warmongers both inside and outside of Russia. Furthermore, while he was indeed a philanderer, he did not live extravagantly, instead endeavoring to lead a modest lifestyle.\n\nOn December 17, 1916, Rasputin was assassinated by nobles and military officers concerned for the empire's future. During his assassination, his cyanide-laced food failed to kill him, leaving the assassins no choice but to execute him with a revolver. After he survived two shots to the heart, they shot him several more times before verifying his death. Then, it is said that they dumped his body into the river from Petrovsky Bridge.\n\nNo records survive which might explain why Rasputin's killers handled his corpse in such a manner.",

    "comment": "With Pseudo-Servants, either the host or Heroic Spirit's personality is dominant. In Rasputin's case, Kirei Kotomine is the dominant personality. It is believed that Rasputin has refrained from asserting his will either because he and Kotomine are in fact quite similar, or because of mutual respect for each other's way of life. \n\nIn Lostbelt Russia, Rasputin's will departed after seeing Duchess Anastasia on her intended path, entrusting Kotomine Kirei with his powers to serve as the Foreign God's apostle.\n\nThe apostles of the Foreign God consist of unique Servants, each blending multiple Heroic Spirits into a single vessel. Besides Rasputin, Kotomine Kirei's Spirit Graph contains the essence of two other beings: Azhi Dahāka, the three-headed dragon and trusted friend of Aŋra Mainiiu, the embodiment of evil in Zoroastrianism's dualistic cosmology, and Bahloo, the immortal moon spirit from Australian folklore who commands three dogs (snakes) and resurrects whenever he dies.\n\n■His Role in a Certain World\nKirei Kotomine was an Overseer dispatched by the Mage's Association and Holy Church, two powerful supernatural organizations. When he was in his twenties, he took part in the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki, which his father oversaw. Afterward, he switched sides to the Association under the pretext of being \"deployed\" by the Church. He then inherited his father's role as Overseer, as one of the few survivors of the Fourth Holy Grail War. Kirei is a qualified Church Executor, and specializes in spiritual medicine. One might assume that he prefers destruction, but like Shirou Emiya, he is a mage who CREATES. His skills at healing wounds of the mind or spiritual body are a match for any prelate.\n\nHe is evil, but not a villain. He is a fiend, but not unjust.

It is older than ancient space, and the goddess Ashtart had a cult of worship within prehistorical ancient civilizations, long before mammals existed on Earth.\nThese humans did not carry the notion of faith at that time, and so they considered goddesses simply to be a term for a sector that enabled life to exist.\nWhether the belief itself or its practices took shape to become a concept is unclear. Either way, Ishtar/Ashtart became a galaxy taking the form of a human. Normally she would not be someone who could be handled by humans, nor would she have ever become a Servant.\n\nBut when Professor Tokiomi coincidently discovered the spiritual core of the goddess, he raised her as the \"good half.\" Even after his death, he left his daughter in the hands of a trusted assistant.\n\"I may only be able to teach the textbook definition of what's good, but being the smart girl that she is, Space Ishtar's likely to see through the hypocrisy of the teachings, and she may lose interest in good and ultimately fall to the side of evil if I'm not there for her.\nHowever, by being close to Jane, who is genuinely good without being two-faced and is able to get to the truth of things (despite paying the price of calling forth destruction and chaos), Space Ishtar may realize that good and evil are not always two sides of the same coin. Hopefully she won't fall to evil that easily.\"\nAs the professor predicted, Space Ishtar grew up with a sound(?) mind and body, and did not fall to evil, instead training to become a superb straight man to Jane's one-woman comedy act. Although she has a short fuse and is a bit stingy, she became a fierce bounty hunter who helps the weak and bites back at the strong.\nMeanwhile, Jane didn't change at all.",

The instant the target feels any satisfaction in the illusion once they are aware that it is, in fact, an illusion, Kiara is able to make the target itself part of the illusion, so they are no longer a creature of this world.

What's more, for some reason, this High Servant had a truly outlandish thought: \"If I'm going to revive, I might as well start from my youth!\"\n\nWhile Kiara turning into her lily form was entirely for her amusement, the transformation also served to deceive Xu Fu. Kiara afflicted her lily form with amnesia, so she would not remember even her own name, which is why her lily form believes herself to be a Pseudo-Servant of the legendary nun Yaobikuni.\n\nAfter returning to the lake to get back at Xu Fu, she concealed her true identity and changed the settings and environment to suit her own enjoyment while keeping the death game rules intact. When the fake Master (Xu Fu) on the B side of the mountain near the lake declared that the group should try \"to resolve the situation,\" she actually meant for them to \"try to figure out who took over the B side of the mountain.\"\n\nIn her lily form, Kiara wholeheartedly desired to help Master, and during tough times, she used her makeup compact (sea shell) to turn into police Kiara (Second Ascension) to combat evil. However, this transformation also brought her memories back, so she reverted to her lily form because \"it would be no fun to reveal everything so quickly.\"",

As they say, simple is best.\nUnlike Dead Apostles, who used to be human before becoming vampires, her abilities were set in stone the moment she was born as a True Ancestor, and will never improve no matter how much blood she drinks. Fortunately for her, she has no need to improve them, as they are already exceptional even for a True Ancestor. Suffice to say, no ordinary vampire would ever stand a chance against her.\n\nHowever, since she is still a True Ancestor, she possesses a thirst for blood that can never be restrained. In fact, most of what she uses her great strength for (approximately seventy percent of it, by most estimates) is to keep those very vampiric impulses sealed away.\n\nIn addition to matching her physical abilities to her opponent, she excels at using Mystic Eyes to mentally meddle with their mind, and reconstructing the world through her Marble Phantasm.\n\nBoth immunity to sunlight and super healing are factors that come to her as natural as she breathes. In her first and third Spirit Origins, she considers battle as a competition to create, blend, and control the elements.\n\nIn the world of \"TSUKIHIME,\" the strongest being of any celestial body is called an Ultimate One or Original One, and Arcueid herself qualifies for this position at the time of her awakening. However, she is not the so-called One until she settles things with Altrouge, one who is also \"that which forms the celestial body.\"\n\n　　　◆\n\nThough respected as a princess, this killer machine had only ever experienced combat, and knew nothing of the joys of so-called \"pointless\" things. However, that changed when she manifested in a Japanese city one day while pursuing a vampire targeted for elimination, and ended up getting killed by a lone human.\nUpon revival, she was bewildered by her newfound shock and anger.

By inheriting Altria's serious demeanor, X focuses on doing everything as quickly and simply as possible. Contrary to her polite and energetic mannerisms, she is extremely competitive (since she's not really aware of this, she is unbelievably dense). She challenged herself to achieve various things, and was absolutely relentless, not giving up until she succeeded. This was a bit problematic, but since she possesses such a virtuous nature, she ended up working to benefit others, so it all worked out okay.\n\nHowever...\nWith the Servant Universe full and boiling over with an excess of Extra Classes, the balance between heroes and villains collapsed. The moment the scales of space tilted toward the villains, XX vowed to change her principles... And then the show headed into a new season.

After working as an art dealer and book seller, he attempted to become a missionary, but ultimately gave up, and instead set out to become a painter himself. He studied under members of the Hague School, and later formed his own artistic style after being influenced by Impressionism.\n\nAfter moving to Arles, France, he created many masterpieces such as \"Sunflowers\". However, his mental health started to suffer after his relationship with his roommate Gaugin deteriorated, which led to the infamous incident of Van Gogh cutting his own ear off. From then on, Van Gogh continued to paint even while suffering from his mental state, and in 1890, at the young age of 37, Van Gogh took his own life. Many scholars argue that there are some inconsistencies surrounding his death.\n\nVan Gogh preferred to use yellow hues and sunflower motifs, as they were symbolic of the sun's rays. He also collected Japanese ukio-e paintings, and would even incorporate them into his own work. In his later years, he was drawn to include cypress trees in his works, and may scholars suggest that they were representations of his view on life and death.",

Truly the position one would expect the undisputed queen of beasts to take.\n\nDespite being both beautiful and cruel, she does not consider affairs of the heart to be a waste of time. As she puts it, her wild nature is all the more reason to cherish love (that is to say, her intuition).\n\nAlthough inherently ruthless and cold-blooded, she enjoys presenting herself as a reasonable, highly capable woman. While she does enjoy tormenting the weak, it's only because her bestial \"law of the jungle\" instincts are so prominent.\nEven when forcing the weak to submit to her completely and utterly, she never forgets to be playful.\n\n\"It would just look silly of me if I were to get too worked up about eradicating humanity, right? So if I'm going to crush them anyway, I'm going to make sure I enjoy myself. That's right. I'm going to kill every last one of you humans as part of a game♡\"\n\nThis fixation of hers to enjoy herself in everything she does mean that her attacks on humanity end up being highly serpentine. Despite coming up with all sorts of ways to oppress humanity, in the end, she decided that being kept like pets by an all-powerful champion would make humans happiest and chose to evolve into the Goddess of Taming, a being eminently well-suited for putting the screws on all of humanity.",

The Oberon of the play quarrels with his queen, Titania, over her new page, and to punish her, Oberon plans to use a concoction that causes one to fall in love with the first person they lay eyes on, and then make the page his own. However, the juice was entrusted to a fairy servant named Robin Goodfellow, whose negligence caused Lysander and Demetrius to be affected by the juice...\n\n　　◆\n\nOberon has been mentioned in numerous other works as well.

That is why the Avalon in which she lives is not shut away from the outside world, but instead positioned as a goal she has set for humanity to strive towards. The staff she wields points to a place just over the horizon. It is a guiding light, and the very hope that still drives people ever forward. That is why she continues to point the way: so those who continue to advance will not falter, in hope that one day, their journey may finally come to an end.\n\nOnce this Noble Phantasm's True Name is released, all nearby can see a far-off utopia that lies in a phantasmal world. They can feel a warm, pleasant spring breeze filled with the scent of flowers—a breeze that feels as though it can melt even the coldest of frozen, desolate seas. It fills those who dream of utopia with the sense that such a thing truly could become reality.",

(If you're wondering, the other was Altria Caster.)\n\nIn consequence of this personal history, Baobhan Sith changed slightly upon her summoning as a Servant.\n\nMorgan, her beloved mother and monarch, announced that they would be spending their summer vacation at a resort. She did not elaborate further.\n\n\"The tropics? Going out and sightseeing with other Servants sounds so ludicrous. Then again, I guess it'll be okay as long as I can spend time with Mother! Pushing around the small fry (*Master) having their fun at the resort might be fun too!\" \n\nAnd so Baobhan Sith, her hopes high, made her way to the tropics. However, the day after her arrival, Baobhan Sith was drawn in by a mysterious voice, deep in the forest. There, she discovered the enshrined deity, pent up with its grudge and nowhere to go.\n\n\"My tummy kinda hurts-nos.\"\n\nSeeing that she couldn't leave the enshrined deity to suffer, Baobhan Sith changed her class to miko, or the maiden of the enshrined deity, to regain its Authority. As she became the maiden of the enshrined deity, Baobhan Sith also changed her name to \"Cait Cú MikoCer.\" (The first part of the name means cat and dog fae, respectively, which are fae from the Scottish Highlands, just like Baobhan Sith. The MikoCer part she came up with on her own.) And so she became a mysterious magical girl set to sabotage the ServantFes and stand in Chaldea's way.\n\n　　　◆\n\nFirst Ascension\nThe maiden of the enshrined deity. The bad guy set to sabotage ServantFes and the boss of the event's opening act. However she wisely came to the conclusion that her methods were not going to be effective, and so began to work on other methods that did not rely on violence.\n\nSecond Ascension\nHer appearance as the \"witch in the house.\" Basically her off-duty persona. Altria Caster and Master found her looking like this when they visited the witch in the house to try to make peace with MikoCer. After a lengthy discussion, it was revealed that MikoCer was a pseudonym, and her Ture Name was Baobhan Sith.\n\nThis came as a surprise to no one at all.\n\nThird Ascension\nThe Tam Lin form she willingly assumed. In the past, Baobhan Sith had no choice but to fight as a Tam Lin. This time, she chose to take this form for the enshrined deity's sake, for ServantFes, and above all, for herself. The pure white bandages wrapped around her are no longer stained with blood as they were before, and she has become an anti-curse faerie set to defeat the Calamity of the Curse.",

(Because she hates futile resistance, she doesn't much like fighting either.) She perceives passion as her enemy. (Note that she is only hostile to it; she does not hate it.)\n\nThough she may not show it outwardly, deep down she seems to long for a human who can overcome temptation and become a small but reliable beacon of light for her.\n\n\"In the universe in its proper state, the beast of the apocalypse shall submit to the earth, while the rose slumbers without rising to the heavens and blooms throughout the land.\"",

In her Third Ascension, she makes a connection with Master after something was proven to her, and a new Draco is born. Ultimately, her essential nature as the Rose Emperor comes to the fore, influencing her personality.\n\nIn this form, she is notably less grumpy, giving her positive, passionate side more of an opportunity to show itself. She affirms humanity's greed, tolerates waste and opulence, and praises Master's struggles. She recognizes Master as a suitable partner, worthy of commanding a Beast like herself, and she will not hesitate to use all her strength for her Master. However, because her personality leans heavily towards her original self, she gets moody if she is not frequently doted on. It's kind of a pain when she gets to pouting though, as she's not honest about her feelings.\n\nShe is arrogant yet devoted, ruthless yet loving, high strung yet lonely. Yes, she may be a Beast who devours the human world but she makes an effort to walk alongside humans. Though she is an Evil of Humanity, she still loves humanity.\n\n\"In the universe in its proper state, the beast of the apocalypse leaves Earth, while the rose blazes across the universe as it goes up in flames, becoming a dazzling star.\"\n\n\nBehavior Towards Master:\nThis is the Draco who has formed a bond of trust with Master.

    "comment": "This \"key\" supposedly existed in Salem, Massachusetts for a time. It was there for a few decades, but considering the key's existence is measured in centuries, that time span is just a blink of an eye. The key was methodically preserved by a thaumaturgist, who came from England. It was wrapped in parchment and then placed inside a box made out of fragrant wood that emitted a sweet-smelling aroma. The key granted special powers to the possessor. But it couldn't be in the hands of just anybody. There were specific conditions that had to be met. The conditions were that the individual had to be innocent, possess the heart of a child, and have knowledge of magecraft. This was because the key was connected to the dream world. This was due to the fact that, according to the \"Book of Eibon,\" \"Necronomicon,\" and other grimoires, the key was created by a thaumaturgist who came from the northern continent that had sunk during the Glacial Period. While it is indeed called a key since it closely resembled the excavated artifacts from the ruins of Rome, there was no lock that was paired with it. It was essentially a key based off of a concept, and it should have actually been called something similar to a staff that thaumaturgists wield. When the catastrophe that was the Witch Trials of Salem occurred, the key should have been lost and hidden away as just another myth or superstition. However, it found an individual who met the conditions to inherit it. The girl's name was Abigail Williams. The girl rightfully and correctly used the key, handed to her by the Demon God Pillar, during sunset, when the hills of the execution site turned crimson the moment the celestial bodies aligned. Iä! Iä! The red seal on the devil's tome inscribed by the women suspected to be witches... The same knots of the same number of nine seals were handled with the same motion fit for each seal...and the girl opened up the door that led to the \"Boundary.\" Iä! Iä! Y-grah'n li'gai gai! Those who gaze back on us from within the abyss of falsity. O lord of the ultimate gate who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams. O, All-in-One and One-in-All being. We must caution those who come in contact with the young girl. The girl's existence shall put the world into uncertainty. But... Oh... Ohhh...\n\n...The excerpt ends there.",

They are usually worn around the wrist as a pair of bracelets, but they quickly turn into a pair of circular blades the moment they leave the body. Nezha uses this weapon like a semi-autonomous drone.\nWhen she throws them up in the air and shouts \"Jí (speed)!\" the Rings shoot towards the enemy. When she shouts \"Tíng (stay)!\" they stop in mid-air, and they return to her hand when she shouts \"Lái (come)!\"\n\nBut there was a time when Nezha didn't carry the Universe Rings.\nThey were taken from her in the battle against Lady Rock, and later retrieved by Taiyi Zhenren, who kept them temporarily.\nFrom the time of Nezha's suicide to save her human parents and atone for her sins until her rebirth, they were out of her possession.\nTo Nezha, this Baobei is closely associated with humiliating and regrettable memories. Therefore, she would never entrust the Universe Rings to another unless she trusted them absolutely.\n\nIf there was someone whom Nezha trusted enough to give one of the Rings, it would mean that she considered that person so close as to be a part of herself.

As Hokusai passed away in the same year at the age of ninety, this painting is often considered one of Hokusai's very last.\nAfter he completed the \"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\" at age seventy, his passion for art didn't fade as he continued to create. He went so far as to dismiss his creations before the \"Thirty-Six Views\" as worthless doodles. It is said he started to grasp the essence of all animal's skeletal structures and the secret of life for all plants at the age of 73. By eighty, he had furthered his understanding of all things in nature. By ninety, he had reached enlightenment. Had he lived to one hundred years old, his skill might have reached the realm of the divine. By one hundred and ten, he could have made his paintings come alive.\nArtists of his time understood the rising dragon over Mt. Fuji to be an auspicious sign, one that signifies a person's rise to success. However, one can also see Hokusai's endless conviction in this painting. Even as he sensed his own end, he did not give in to despair and continued his endless pursuit of artistic heights none before him had ever attained.",

It belonged to Princess Angelica, who hailed from the land of Cathay, and it's a wonderful piece that is said to be able to nullify all kinds of magecraft. Thanks to this ring, I was able to emerge victorious from my battle against the evil mage Atlante.\n\nPrincess Angelica was very beautiful. My older brother Rinaldo, and even the paladin Roland both were enthralled by her at one point... And if two out of the Twelve Paladins fell in love with her, then wow, she must've been super attractive!\n\nMy Princess, where are you and what are you doing now...?\n...\n...\nOh, that's right. We aren't in the era when I was alive anymore.\nI was just reminiscing. Sorry. But I still do hope we can see each other again one day.\n\nCome again? If I've kept such an important ring this whole time, the Princess might be angry when we reunite? Ahhh! Y-y-you're right! What should I do!? I-I-I can't believe I ended up doing the sort of thing 'Stolfo does!",

As Saiken worships and Shichisei flies by, what Taimatsu lights up is the treasured spear of Biten.\"\n\nKagetora possessed many swords, but she preferred wielding eight treasured swords and spears, naming this technique Hakka no Sonae, the Flourishing Eight Defenses, and of these she relied heavily on a treasured spear that had no signature. This is also one of the reasons why Kagetora was summoned as a Lancer, even though she had the capacity to be a Saber or Rider.\n\n\"So why am I a Lancer, you ask? Well, let's just say I had some unfinished business in my past life. If I can meet THEM on the battlefield once again, I'm going to pulverize them completely. And...AND! I wouldn't want people to point out that I lost because I wasn't in my more natural Rider class, so I relinquished the Rider spot for them. And that's why I've manifested as a Lancer. Ahahahaha!\"",

I can't count how many times it saved my ass.\n\nI had it on during the battle inside Troy too. I bet the enemy soldiers were terrified to see a commander wearing an iron helmet that barely showed his face. To tell you the truth, I was hoping that would be the effect. Haha.\n\nThough I don't think the Aegis was ever mentioned in the \"Iliad,\" nor even in \"The Odyssey.\"\nThat's not surprising.\nYou may not believe this, but Athena's actually shy. She probably didn't want future generations to know that she gave a divine treasure to a human because she felt such affection for him.\n...\n...\nSo...has Athena manifested in Chaldea...?\nNo, didn't think so.\n\nAnyway, I just want to say that the Aegis was always with me now.\nBut it was only with me during the most tempestuous and dramatic period of my life.\nWhen I wasn't out on my adventures, but rather living peacefully, my prized Aegis was properly polished and displayed.\nWho polished it, you ask?\nThat would have to be me or my dear Penelope!",

It is said that his experience during this crash was what inspired him to write the novella \"The Little Prince\". Saint-Exupéry was a plane enthusiast, so much so he purchased yet another airplane even after his crash, going so as far as to incur considerable debt. Throughout his life, he had many crashes and accidents. One such accident at the age of twenty-three caused him to break off an engagement. At the age of thirty-five, when he crash landed in a desert, he managed to survive for four days on only one day's worth of water until he was rescued by a nomadic tribe called the Bedouin. Finally at the age of forty-four, he was assigned to a military scouting mission using an unarmed aircraft. He was shot down and finally met his demise.\n\nWhile he was a well-known author, he was an aviator at heart, a man who continued to look up to the sky.\n\n\"...Well, at least that's how the legend goes.

As the nation was plagued by constant conflict, the shrine maiden who received oracles from the starry heavens became queen. The queen's shrine was surrounded by sturdy fences and guarded by numerous soldiers, and a great many attendants served her. However, since she became queen, she never met anyone outside the confines of her shrine, and only one person, her nameless brother, was said to have assisted her and delivered her oracles.\n\nYep. Even though I was queen, I was living this life of solitude. And anytime I tried to sneak out of the shrine, it would always rain, which kept me from going out. So the only thing I could do was either more divinations or polish my mirrors. I had tons of mirrors, but this one's special. My brother got it from me from...somewhere, before I became queen. I spent a lot of time looking into it when I was bored.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the mirror. Whenever my stomach growled, my brother would give me his own food, and he would dote on me, always saying \"Sister\" this and \"Sister\" that. Even after I became queen, he would constantly run errands in my place. He really did so much for me, and he offered everything he had to me. In the end, no one even remembered him... He became this nameless brother of mine. And this is the mirror he gave me.\n\n...My favorite mirror.",

Despite living a long and full life, he spoke little about his comrades he fought alongside in the past, even towards the end of his life. In the age when the life of the samurai started to fade away, this man firmly stood his ground and continued to live like a samurai.\n\nThat sounds really good in writing, but in truth, I actually have pretty loose lips. The moment I open my mouth, I just blabber about all kinds of things that may or may not be true. One time, there was this young man who was training really hard with his wooden sword at a dojo, and I just went right in and gave him this long lecture on the importance of tsuki. You know what? You don't have time to think about how to properly attack or parry. You just get really into the moment and start swinging your sword around. You get what I mean?\n\nThat's just how it was back in the day though.\n\nThey immersed themselves in fighting, laughed and cried enthusiastically, and died in a frenzy. That's how they all lived in that age. That's when I thought I should at least live my life carrying my own banner till the very end.\n\nOne member of the Shinsengumi who fought through the turbulent age of the Bakumatsu and survived.

But ultimately I still chose to do so because I'm confident that you would understand. So this is me. This is my face that you had shown me to love. If I'm talking from Clytie's standpoint, I tried painting in the style from the Arles period because I like its coloring. It's probably close in style of that sunflower painting that sold for a few million. But this painting for you should go perfectly well on the right side of the wall in your drab room. And if for some unfortunate reason you find yourself struggling, you can go ahead and sell it. But when you do, I look forward to you buying me a cup of coffee and telling me the story of how much that \"painting of an unknown monster girl with an authentic Van Gogh autograph\" sold for.\nIt looks like I'm reaching my limit with my advanced Van Gogh joke of borrowing Vincent's artistic talent and writing style. The haughtiness is crushing me, and I still need to explain myself to Gioconda Da Vinci who keeps banging on my door on why I used so much painting materials during my many trial and errors for this painting. (Though her existence as an artist still puzzles me no matter how many times I hear the story). Luckily Hokusai's with me so she can probably side with me. Oh...as I was writing this sentence, she took off leaving the little black Hokusai behind, so now I don't have anyone else to sweet talk my way out!\nI'm going to entrust this letter and painting to the little black Hokusai. If you see me in the halls nursing a bump on my head, some treatment and consolation would be appreciated.\n\nWith my unwavering loyalty and friendship, a handshake to you.",

Everything was executed masterfully, and the weight of her bulging bag full of presents was just as much of a threat as a swing of her black sacred sword. I only won because the ring was too small for her sled.\n\nThe second Santa was just in a different division, so it ended with no contest. I didn’t even fight her. She just gave up the belt. But at the same time, we were able to talk about what a Santa should be. This belt without a doubt carries her feelings as well.\n\nThe third Santa was a formidable opponent. Had she been in a better condition, I might have been in trouble. Did you know that sheep’s wool absorbs impact from punches? That was truly a great learning experience for me.\n\nOh right. I do have to say that the fourth Santa was my strongest opponent yet. She came straight at me in close quarters. She used very strange steps that prevented my punches from hitting, and her numerous killer Christmas techniques... Honestly, I don’t know that I would fare better if I went up against her in the future. I would very much like a rematch, and I’m sure the feeling is mutual. Perhaps I should also incorporate that rhythm into my footwork. Samba...she called it?\n\nThe fifth Santa was a terrifying opponent...in a different way. I can’t believe she tried attacking a boxer with a syringe... Even if she did that out of kindness, there was no way I was going to allow myself to take such a hit. I'd immediately be disqualified the moment I was suspected of doping. So in a sense, this match kept me on my toes the most.\n\nSo I managed to obtain this through those battles...but to be honest, I shouldn’t be the one wearing this belt.\n\nI think it should be given to Master, who handled me as Santa Claus so well. But I can’t seem to convince them to accept it. That why...at best, I should probably be considered the provisional champion. It’s likely there will be another Santa next year. I guess I’ll just have to keep on training until a title match with them gets arranged...",

Even when the prince stood up, and even after she caught a glimpse of his heart, the princess never wavered. \n\nIt was the place discarded faeries gathered. Even though the prince ridiculed the other faeries as the dregs of Faerie Britain, he never did move his residence away from the Autumn Woods. \n\nWhenever he did something good, he would carefully wash his hands in the forest river. Whenever he did something bad, he would collapse on a leaf while his wings were still dirty. The prince loathed everything about Britain. So too did he loathe the faeries of the Autumn Woods. But...\n\n\"I’m no god. You can't expect me to care for a bunch of losers who just disappear on their own.\"\n\nHaving learned what the prince truly despised, the princess promised herself she would flap her wings until the end for his sake, believing that she was the only fire that could warm his cold limbs.\n\n◆\n\nThis is a fragment of an untold tale—the story of a proud princess a liar hid from the world.",

Everyone, including the creature herself, thought she would feed on her anger, her grief, and her resentment until her malice swallowed her whole.

That was all they needed.\n\nAnd while it took several bizarre twists of fate for it to happen, their wish—their promise—was eventually fulfilled.\n\nEven if their newly found time together was no more than a fleeting illusion, it didn't matter.

He hunted beasts, vanquished evil, and carried battles to victory. But after many years of fighting to protect humankind, that god was betrayed and killed by those same humans. Yet even after being run through with their blades, the god spoke not a word of anger or resentment towards his killers. Instead, he merely accepted his fate.\n\nThus did this god and protector of humankind have his body cruelly cut to pieces, his name stolen, and his existence as a deity ended by the very people he had spent his life protecting.\n\nWell, I don't know if that's actually true or not, but regardless, that's Zanzaburo's story.\n\nAt any rate, when I found him in the treasury, he was so shabby that I genuinely couldn't believe he was actually the legendary husk of an ancient god. Still, as I was looking at his beat-up face, I found myself feeling so sorry for him that I decided to fix up his armor and helmet. That's how he became the Zanzaburo he is today.\n\nAfterwards, we began traveling together, dancing together, and vanquishing evil together.\n\nI may not know who my parents were, or where I was born, or really anything about myself, so in one sense, Zanzaburo is really the only family I have...\n\nOh, but that's enough for the sappiness. It looks like we've still got some trouble ahead of us tonight. There are dangerous creatures out there that we'll need to take care of with our evil-slaying dance.\n\nWake up, Zanzaburo!\n\nThat's right.

Ranmaru also went to Interstellar Flying Sword cram school three times a week, fighting the urge to grab a bite to eat on the way home by making do with bitter bell peppers. Those were definitely not easy days for Ranmaru. But fortunately, they're also far in the past now that Ranmaru has achieved Ranmaru's life dream of finding a lord Ranmaru can serve with pride for the rest of Ranmaru's life.\n\nEven though Ranmaru holds the title of Mysterious Ranmaru X, Ranmaru never knew what the \"Mysterious\" part meant.

Most foes will die if you use this to shatter their skull.\"\n\nWell, that's pretty obvious. Just about every living thing will die if it has their skull shattered, no matter what is used to do it.\n\nThis is not a whip in the traditional sense, as it lacks rope or string. Instead, it's more of a bar-shaped weapon meant for direct bludgeoning. Taigong Wang apparently prefers it over bladed weapons.\n\n\"It kind of looks like a fishing pole, right? ...Okay, maybe that's a stretch, but it certainly looks more like one than a sword. Besides, there's something elegant about how it doesn't look much like a traditional weapon at all. Hmm, how can I put this...? Oh, I know! It's not barbaric at all!\"\n\nAh, I see. Well that makes sense. So how do you fight with this whip then?\n\n\"Mostly by shattering my opponents' skulls.\"\n\n...I see. Nothing barbaric about that at all.

If that's true...does that mean she saved Britain from a looming threat? That she triumphed over calamity?\n\n...There was no response. As though the silence itself speaks to the endless catastrophes that have yet to come. The young Gareth peers down at the mystic blade lying broken at her feet, completely silent.",

I am sure it will be more satisfying for you than if I were still in my small Assassin form. Consider it your reward for a job well done. Savor this good fortune while it lasts. But be sure you do not confuse the sunscreen for the chicken blood. That would make a mess in more ways than one.\n\nHm? You wish to know why I also have these Taoist instruments here? Why, there is no telling when undead monstrosities may intrude upon this beach, of course. If I am going to exorcise such spirit creatures, I may as well get it out of the way. So this summer, I am going to hunt down every last spirit beast I can find and add all those lost corpses to my jiāngshī army! Or at least, that is my goal. I am prepared to face them no matter when they appear, and that includes during the day. Hence, the sunscreen. Now hurry and put it on me already!\n\n...Ohhh. Now I understand. You are dragging your feet to give yourself as much time as possible to admire me in my swimsuit, aren't you? Well, aren't you adorable. Very well then, in that case...\n\nEven when she's supposed to be on summer vacation, the hard-working empress never forgets her duties.\n\nI wanted her to at least relax while she was out here, so I put on sunscreen like she asked. As a reward, she gave me a jiāngshī talisman that she claimed had been custom-made.\n\nWhen I turned it over, I found a pinup-style picture of her in her swimsuit.",

If we chase it down, this moment—and summer—will last forever!\"\n\nBut then the sun finally sinks below the horizon, we both look at each other and laugh at the inevitable. This moment, though, is exactly what makes this time so precious. One day, summer will end. That's why it's important to really enjoy every moment of it. You don't try to stop it from ending; you enjoy it because you know eventually it will. Once we have both agreed and acknowledged that immutable fact, we go full throttle and slice through the waves.\n\n\"Did you give it your all? No regrets? Good for you! Suuuper jelly! Spending your summer like that is the best part of your youth! You couldn't do everything because there was too much you wanted to do? But you gave it your all, right? Then that's okay. Those memories are priceless summer treasures!

Wandjina refers to this as a \"droplet.\" Should an ordinary put it on, it will drench them. Surprisingly, however, they will not drown. As Wandjina is a spirit that blesses life, this equipment will not harm anyone, even should they touch it. Rather, they are invigorated, their life force revitalized.\n\nBut be warned: this droplet is a Noble Phantasm that is one or two steps away from an Authority. Should one try to take it from Wandjina, there will be trouble. Even if Wandjina doesn't get angry, there's a strong chance the other spirits, fairies, or even Divine Spirits would grow truly enraged.\n\nWhich is why, even if you see it just lying around, handle it with care!",

It is not a matter of admiration, but of mourning. There is nothing more beautiful than what you cannot ever reclaim.\"\n\nI couldn't agree with him. After all...\n\n\"Yeah. That's right, brother.

I know very well why you are so restless...like you're waiting for someone.\nBut would you spare a few minutes to listen to what I, Medea, would like to say?\n\nWhat I want to discuss is my magecraft workshop.\nThey...they took it over! Auntie and Medea Lily!\n\nThey said they were going to convert it into a kitchen so they could make confections!\nAnd they were going to call it the Witches’ Kitchen, and it will only be open on Valentine’s Day!\nWhat a nuisance. Besides, calling it the Witches’ Kitchen is a bad idea. It’s like blatantly admitting that the food has special properties and ingredients!\nBut then Auntie said...\n“We, as highly celebrated witches of myth, must create and use only objects of the highest quality...from confectionary-making tools to aprons! It’s like just like how one must have the proper feathers if one wishes to fly!”\n...She was quite enthusiastic about it.\nJust the fact that she’s spending time making sweets is taking away from her being a witch... Doesn’t she realize that she’s just an amateur pâtissier at this point?\nShe even tried to persuade me to join, but I politely declined.\n\nEh? You think that’s a shame?\nI already got involved because I lent them my aprons?\n\n...Your eye is keen as ever. I confess, it’s true. \nNever mind Lily, but Auntie...\nShe may not seem it, but she actually looks good no matter what she wears.\nSo I may have gone a bit overboard, working feverishly at my sewing machine.\nBut Auntie was a bit judgmental. She said that she never knew I had such homely talents! Ugh!\n\nAt any rate, I’m quite proud of how cute the little chef coats turned out. I can’t speak to the quality of the pastries, but I want you to at least pay attention to how wonderful their outfits are. \nSince it seems I have no choice, I suppose I will let my workshop go for now and just crash in some Saber’s room.\n\nThat’s why I’m here, Master. I have a few questions.\nAuntie’s been barging into my room, day and night, asking me so many things.\n\nHere are some of the things one of mythology’s greatest witches has been asking of me:\n“I want to know what Master’s favorite flavor is. Do you think they like it really sweet? Or would bitter be better?”\n“Are there any seasonings Master doesn’t like? You know, so I can balance things properly in the future..”\n“Now that I think about it, handmade confections are so lame. What do you think, Medea?”\n“If Master was a pig in their past life, what breed do you think they’d have been? I hear there’s a hybrid brand of pigs called Tokyo ● from Japan. Sounds romantic, huh? It has ● in its name!”\nWho cares about breeds...\n“Hey Medea...I hear that Master is really traumatized by Valentine’s Day.

Don’t you agree, Master?\nBut it does look like, in spite of herself, she’s doing her best, so would you be so kind as to answer the questions I asked? \nOh, it’s fine.

While praying, they recalled the discussion with the young couple.\nThey are with child, and they want the aging couple to think of a name for their unborn child.\nA lotus flower is a symbol of children and a prayer for safe childbirth.\nAfter some thought, the shop owners decide to accept the order.",

It is a story of an ordinary main character who deepens his bond with various heroines.\n\nThe first heroine is able to communicate with spirits, and knew the main character long before the main character knew her. When they are reunited a few years later, it appears he forgot the important promise made with the heroine. \"Hnngh. It feels like I'd be a loser if I reminded him of my promise...so I'll make the spirits jog his memory!\" Oh, also, within just two days of their reunion, there was a whole scare about the main character having to suddenly move away.\n\nThe second heroine is a senpai-next-door sort of heroine who had always taken good care of the main character. She could be both stern and sweet. The way she embraces the main character is more akin to how a big sister or mother might do so. But, be warned that she can be more frightening than an oni when angered. \"Oh my, look how dirty you are. Would you like me to give you a bath while I rubby-rub you all clean like we did back in the day?\"\n\nThe third heroine is...well, she's a stalker who fell in love with the main character at first sight after he came into her home to shelter from the rain. Their first words were exchanged when the main character peeked under his bed in the middle of the night, sensing something strange. \"I love you! Kya! I said it! When should we sign our marriage certificate?\"\n\nAt their school, there's an urban legend that says that anyone who summons the goddess of love under the legendary tree will find the love they desire. But obviously, the heroines vying for the affection of the main character surely will not let their rivals get ahead. And so, the goddess who flirts with the bear remains up in the heavens, while the great war for love rages down on the surface...",

The memory of the two of you flying through the azure sky during that one summer day is somehow in every bite of these chocolates.",

Like a wedding announcement, the purpose of these chocolates is to make sure everyone knows that she obtained happiness...apparently.\n\nAccording to her, each of the chocolates depicting Xiang Yu has him smiling, glaring, angry, sleepy, gazing, calculating...and this represents a collection of \"wonderful facial expressions that would make anyone's heart skip a beat.\" It's frankly hard to tell them apart. Additionally, there is apparently a rule regarding how to eat these chocolates which forbids the eater from breaking the chocolates in any way that might seem to split the illustrated couple up. The greatest crime, which is punishable by death, is splitting the chocolate cleanly in half.\n\n...It's a real pain to eat.",

Some may note that Haniwa were made dominantly during the Kofun period (later than the Yamataikoku period), but that's okay because the queen has provided an oracle saying that the latter half of the Yayoi period just barely makes the cut.\n\nTo the queen, whose only hobby during her life was collecting Haniwa and mirrors (how rude!), there is no doubt that her Haniwa aesthetic skills are at an A+ level, which is quite an extraordinary feat heretofore unwitnessed in Japanese history. And thanks to this skill, her Haniwa molding powers have enabled her to create very endearing Haniwa. On top of that, some sort of mysterious light wave emanates from it, which makes it feel like it's healthy too!\n\nOnce upon a time, a certain older sister and younger brother enjoyed a moment kneading clay together. That's right...to her, this handmade chocolate is a gift for one she considers to be extremely important.",

Naturally, its power is scaled down appropriately and can only incinerate a 3-meter radius. Adequate for self-defense—or rather, wildly overpowered for that purpose.

There're even a few raunchy scenes, so the embarrassment level increases threefold.\n\nShe claims there is no specific model for the person with whom the protagonist falls in love, but of course this is not true. There's definitely, and very obviously, a model. While the doujin was being drawn, she though no one would ever notice. Afterward, she was astonished to realize there was in fact no way they would NOT notice!\n\nIf they realized but never said anything, they're mean. If they haven't realized, they're just dense.\n\nOh, but...maybe I actually enjoy this vague state. And if so, I sincerely wish it will go on forever.\n\nAs a side not, this title was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing, so there is no actual iron whip in the work.",

However, if readers follow the fine print and try to call the contact information written on the back, someone with a blunt, doctoral tone will not hesitate to tell you the conversion value without any problem.\n\n\"Ultimately, it doesn't matter how the information is relayed as long as the correct data is shared some way or another...right?\"",

The god of love, as a result, gained infinity, and naturally became weary of love. Thus, she tries to fulfill everything using her own infinite love. After all, if the universe (humanity) is fulfilled by her love, then there would be no further annoyance of the love affairs between people that so irk her.\n\nThis Beast scatters passion (or arrows of it) throughout humanity that are sufficient to burn the universe. Anything goes. It doesn't matter how low they stoop. Love them through and through even if they are corrupted to the point of becoming animals. Embrace them. That kind of ultimate pampering is what Kama/Mara can offer. She offers love (temptation) as she once did for Buddha...but now to each and every person of this universe.\n\n\"The vow to cut off all vexations...must be so hard on you. Don't worry, I'll burn all your worries away.\"\n\nThe sight of her enjoying herself by scorning the Buddha's vow with a smile is the very image of the Demon King, the great enemy in Buddhism.\n\nAnd so, based on her original nature, her class was determined:\nThe god of love is a false name.\nThe byproduct of a god of evil...the greatest catastrophe that is said to save humanity itself.\nHer name: Beast III/L.\nShe is one of the Seven Evils of Humanity, the Beast possessing the aspect of lust.",

    "comment": "Beast IV: L originally came into being as the collective death throes of the land and animals that died during the Tunguska incident. The pain of the land that was literally blown away... The cries of the animals that were killed in an instant, helpless in the face of their fate... These all mixed together into a residual Spirit Origin, or prototypical Singularity, if you prefer, that remained at ground zero as a distortion in spacetime.\n\nIf that was all there was to her story, she may well have faded away with no one else even knowing she existed. But on January 1st, 2019, when the previous Beast IV abdicated his position, she was included in the candidates to fill his seat, and transformed into an Evil of Humanity. She took on a new Alter Ego Spirit Origin using Tamamo-no-Mae, a Nature Spirit, as a reference, and began undertaking efforts to wipe out humankind. Her goal in doing so was to act on the collective will of all animals (including humans, of course) and sever all connections with the human world. In a sense, it was not unlike someone filing for divorce against their spouse.\n\nHer ultimate goal was to build a world of new animals in Earth's existing environments where the animals would not hurt humans, nor where humans would hurt the animals, and to stay there as she watched modern humanity go extinct.\n\nThough she may have the body of a Beast, her true form is that of the earth itself. As a being who simultaneously oversees both a zone full of animal life, and a zone where animals are slaughtered and killed, it would not be inaccurate to describe Beast IV as the Eighth Lostbelt.",

Nonetheless, as the embodiment of the unforgiving natural world, she would (almost) never coddle them. Furthermore, despite her inherent cruelty, she is still Tamamo-no-Mae at heart, which means she is also just a little bit of a softie.\n\nAs a rule, she has no respect for human rights, and is actively working towards wiping out all of humankind. Yet although she hates the human species, and finds everything humans do disgusting, she doesn't hate them because they're dirty.

    "comment": "Although Koyanskaya was originally thought to be a Disciple of the Foreign God and one of her three Alter Egos, the truth turned out to be very different. In fact, she intentionally acted in such a way as to make Chaldea think that was the case.\n\nOn January 1st, 2019, after the Incineration of Humanity incident, a juvenile Beast of Affection independently manifested in Russia as one of the candidates to take Beast IV's place.\nWhile it's easy to think she may be one of the Tamamo Nine, since she looks so much like Tamamo-no-Mae, that too was just an intentional red herring. She's actually a Nature Spirit made up of all the pain and suffering of the animals that died, and the nature that was harmed, during the Tunguska incident of 1908; the collective thoughts and feelings of animals persecuted by humans incarnated into physical form. During that incarnation, she chose Tamamo-no-Mae's Spirit Origin for her vessel, since she believed her and Tamamo to be two tails of a fox (i.e. Beasts who lived to take revenge on humans).\nEven Tamamo-no-Mae herself was so convinced Koyanskaya was so much like her that she thought she might be her Alter, despite having no recollection of Koyanskaya being one of her tails.\n\nShortly after she founded her company for the purpose of wiping out humanity, she was contacted by the Foreign God, where they formed a contract of mutual non-interference with the other's goal. From then on, she acted as though she was fully on board the Foreign God's plan, even doing her part to help further it.\nBut in fact, despite her originally manifesting in order to fill the vacant Beast IV seat, it seems what Koyanskaya really wanted was to enjoy watching Chaldea and the Foreign God fall at each others' hands rather than compete directly with either of them herself.\n\nIncidentally, her ears are not fox ears, but rabbit ears. As rabbits exist solely to be prey, and since she contains a rabbit's soul deep down in her core, she has no sympathy for predators regardless of whether she's allied with them, and has a small soft spot for prey.",

    "comment": "In the confrontation between the Foreign God and Chaldea, Koyanskaya's ultimate goal was to sweep in after one had lost, absorb them both, and become a new Evil of Humanity. Not as Beast IV: L, but as herself.\nIf Koyanskaya had had her way, she would have liked nothing more than for Chaldea to emerge victorious so she could sew the Master who saved humankind to her body as her ninth tail, followed by making them watch as humanity was finally destroyed. \"Now that would be the perfect cherry on top♡\"\n\n...But then, in the Sixth Lostbelt, her friend Murian asked her to protect Faerie Britain, and to do so required her to shield Chaldea (or in this case, the Storm Border) from Cernunnos's hands, for they were the only ones capable of bringing Britain salvation. Right after doing so, she was injected with the stagnation Cernunnos had built up thanks to Oberon's plot, causing her Spirit Origin to swell in size. No longer able to control her own power, Koyanskaya was then forced to retreat from the Sixth Lostbelt.\nAfterwards, she escaped to the Anti-Primate Biosphere she had been building in secret on the bleached-white Earth, where she then had no choice but to begin metamorphosing into her fully-grown form, despite knowing it was still too soon.\n\n　　　◆\n\nAlthough Koyanskaya did succeed in becoming an Evil of Humanity, she remained immature and half-grown at heart, thereby ensuring she could never become a disaster for all of humanity. This is also why she has no Beast name, for as the Beast of Taming she couldn't bring herself to attack humanity directly.\nIt is for these reasons that she was unable to become the class she wanted, and why she is a far cry from the nation-ruining beauty she claims to be. In the end, Beast IV: Lost turned out to be no more than a biosphere walking hand in hand with human history, unable to completely forsake humankind. She is merely a beast with an affectionate side who failed to become the seventh Evil of Humanity.",
